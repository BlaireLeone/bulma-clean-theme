## Why I created this blog

As a kid, I was active and excited by nature. I also grew up in a rural part of the mountains, which lead me to have a natural respect for the environment. But in my teens and early 20’s I started thinking more deeply about my individual impact on my surrounding environment. I was anxious about my impact on the environment and constantly overanalyzing health choices. This feeling heightened the more I tuned into the world around me.

It was difficult to hear about the onslaught of natural disasters occurring over the last few years or the forecasts of what our world would look like in 20, 50, 100 years due to Climate Change. Not only because it’s sad to think of the Earth changing, but also because the rate of human change does not follow Earth’s change, and it’s heartbreaking to hear of the damage Climate Change causes for populations around the world. I felt, and still feel, a deep existential dread.

On top of that, in the US alone, we are reckoning with a social landscape that subsidizes some groups and undercuts others. As a white women born into an average middle-class upbringing, I am privy to more security than others, and I don’t want to take that lightly. While this might not obviously connect to health, sustainability, and frugality, I believe that our choices are not mutually exclusive.

The cellphone I decided to buy two years ago because it was cheap, durable, straightforward, and, importantly, not an Apple product? It was made in China. But really, it was only assembled in China. The individual parts were manufactured in a dozen other countries, processed from minerals that were mined from a dozen more, with freighters transporting the materials back and forth across the globe. Once assembled, it was then probably shipped to the US or elsewhere before getting to the US, where it was shipped over land to new facilities, and passed between dozens of pairs of hands belonging to low-wage workers, a majority of whom belong to marginalized populations. This all before it was packaged and sent to me. 

Not only did this small, seemingly insignificant, decision touch so many people, in mining and transporting the materials, whole ecosystems were affected.

I realize that this could be perceived as me soliloquizing to never buy anything, ever, in case it leaves a mark. But that's not what I mean. Instead, I hope for a consumption reckoning. For individuals to be more mindful and intentional when buying, or more broadly, when following habits. This relies on making conscious choices that ask what timeline do I create with this decision?



### A couple notes that I feel the need to address as I write this

1. When reading this, it’s easy to think I’m saying that the time we are living in now is the worst it’s ever been. However, in reality, I think it’s over-aggrandizing to say that; I’m sure every generation can point to contemporary events of the same nature. Instead, I hope to relate that current events and forecasts concern me. And this makes me hyper-aware of the choices I make and what I can do to reduce my part of the forecast.

2. I’ve had discussions over the years with multiple people about how the problems of today are not an individual’s problems to solve – they are the companies, governments, corporations, etc. that have created oceans of wasteland and promoted over-consumption through psychological manipulation, unfair commercial practices (among others), and more, on such a massive scale that it would be impossible to make a difference. 

   While I agree that as an individual, I’m not going to move the needle make a noticeable global change, I still hope to promote a lifestyle where I don’t support policy decisions or products that perpetuate these problems. Don't let 'best' be the enemy of 'better'. Best in this sense would be the companies taking ownership and paying retribution for the damage they've inflicted. But better, is what I'm able to do, which helps even on the smallest of scales. In a way, I’m voting with my dollar, but in the end I'm voting with my values. 







**Weekly Spotlight: Albizia**
Albizia is a traditionally Chinese herb from the Mimosa, or Persian Silk, tree (though it has roots in many medicinal traditions from around the world). The flowers, which are actually a large cluster of long colorful stamens, are often compared to fireworks or starbursts, and have a soft silky feel - hence the origin of the name Persian Silk tree. In Nevada County, you can find the delicate leafy fronds and fluffy pink or yellow flowers growing in more temperate zones where it has access to water. To identify it, look for medium height trees with giant clusters of tiny-leafed stems, often hanging in shaggy looking fronds, and large puffy flowers that give the tree a broad and branchy body. With its color and bulkiness, once you can identify it, Albizia is easy to spot from a distance!![Image result for albizia drawing](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/bz9f_OXhkPp9vUGclAUXeYCio89ogSqP4-Z2zVutKjzCygfBEsC0wKPvYoiqj8xn17V5-AFvlSLmOVa-7nFAmhG69oO5UG_Hpk2mvbECAAJQhEGBBwxFZpRzdswTkovI7Z1_g-pI)
What is Albizia used for?
“Albizia is one of our holistic herbs,” says Shea, owner of HAALo. And it’s no wonder. Albizia contains antioxidant, sedative, and analgesic properties; it has many uses from anxiety relief, to sleep-aid, to pain relief, to skin care.
Albizia is used both internally, via tea or tinctures, or externally, via balms or poultices. And both albizia flowers and bark are considered medicinal.![img](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pAw6NTA_U8-Jauio4pxIAixbLRjFFsHVZl6urq6tRmw5IbMTmpr9HiN0EOY5icyaGo822Ouq3BMumbQNaZI_EDPk-R5X4DPDoPd4rE3YSown1MTK_sn1c7Xl2NJcLVm_enC3r7ws)
Referred to also as the *happiness herb*, “albizia has been used for centuries to help with stress, anxiety, and depression”, says Shea. It’s sedative properties dampen the nervous system and even out hormonal imbalances when stressed or anxious. In doing so, it can also alleviate feelings of depression or irrational anger that arise from stress or sudden hormone spikes.

It is also useful in treating insomnia and promoting restful sleep. Here, stress and anxiety also play key roles, as the act of alleviating a frayed nervous system, also allows for a better night’s sleep.
Externally, the albizia bark can be used for trauma and injury. The antioxidant and analgesic qualities can reduce pain and swelling, promote blood circulation and regeneration of flesh, and help heal bone fractures. In certain applications it can also heal rashes, wounds, and acne.
