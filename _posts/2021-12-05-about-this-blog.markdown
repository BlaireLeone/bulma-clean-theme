# What is Conscious Consumerism?

Conscious Consumerism has no fixed definition and in fact isn't listed in any modern dictionary. I've found several unofficial definitions of who a conscious consumer is, from [someone who looks at a label](https://medium.com/naturehub/what-is-a-conscious-consumer-and-why-does-it-matter-4b7a14ca08fc#:~:text=A%20conscious%20consumer%2C%20in%20a%20nutshell%2C%20is%20someone,is%20always%20a%20company%20motive%20to%20think%20about.) to someone who is [always conscious](https://earthhero.com/what-is-a-conscious-consumer/) to someone who has an [awareness while purchasing](https://bezen.eco/conscious-consumerism-and-its-relevance/) especially with locally produced, ethical, and environmentally friendly goods.

Conscious consumerism is open to interpretation. I believe it can be narrowed down from 'always conscious', but is more generous than just looking at labels. I also don't believe it needs to apply only to purchasing. Or else, I believe that our purchases are effected by every aspect of our lives - thus conscious consumerism to me not only involves ethical purchases but healthy personal habits.
