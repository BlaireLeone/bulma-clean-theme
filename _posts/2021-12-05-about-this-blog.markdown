# About this blog

In the past few years, I have become very health and sustainability conscious. I have always been the frugal type, having been raised by financially scrupulous parents. In college, I became aware of the fact that most of my frugal habits were incidentally also sustainable and, in some respects, healthy. For instance, bringing my own bags to the store, avoiding take-out, reusing jars and containers, etc.

I was raised with a lifestyle very similar to the one I currently have, so in many ways I am just promoting my parent’s values. But previously, I never had reasons for my habits – I mostly did them, because it didn’t occur to me not to.

My journey to this blog was a gradual awakening, as day after day I became aware of habits I didn’t realize I had, or didn’t realize had such an impact on mine and the environment’s health. After meta-analyzing my choices time and again, I tried to determine the most ethical version of my decisions. I now search for healthier solutions and habits that least impact (and hopefully support) my personal health and the environment at large.

I’m constantly learning, about myself and the surrounding the world. And new research to the field provides even more insight and opportunities for growth. Through this blog, I’ll share what I’ve learned and along the way, provide in-depth reporting on complex nuanced topics to explain my decisions. I hope this information can help others become conscious consumer - to make decisions and build habits that allow for a healthier, more sustainable, and hopefully, cheaper lifestyle.

### What do I mean by health?

Health is a spectrum. When I refer to health, I mostly mean personal health, but it also applies to environmental health.

Personal health too means several things: diet, exercise, hygiene, emotional stability, and other forms of wellness. Environmental health, refers not only to the environment at large, but also to one’s immediate surrounding environment.
