# About

------

One thing I've learned in my own journey to living a conscious consumer lifestyle is that most people generally agree that they would like be healthy and low-impact, but haven't really thought about how or why. I've noticed, however, that it is our routines and habits, or our subconscious daily behaviors, that impede us the most in this desire. Often we are not aware of our habits, or our habits are so ingrained that they are hard to redirect.

Through this blog, I’ll share what I’ve learned on my journey to be a conscious consumer and give tips on how to build healthier habits. I hope this information can help other conscious consumers make decisions and build habits that allow for a healthier, more sustainable, and hopefully, cheaper lifestyle.

# What is Conscious Consumerism?

While Conscious Consumerism has no fixed definition, and in fact isn't listed in any modern dictionary, several sustainability-adjacent websites provide their own take. According to these websites, a conscious consumer can be [someone who looks at a label](https://medium.com/naturehub/what-is-a-conscious-consumer-and-why-does-it-matter-4b7a14ca08fc#:~:text=A%20conscious%20consumer%2C%20in%20a%20nutshell%2C%20is%20someone,is%20always%20a%20company%20motive%20to%20think%20about.) to someone who is [always conscious](https://earthhero.com/what-is-a-conscious-consumer/) to someone who has an [awareness while purchasing](https://bezen.eco/conscious-consumerism-and-its-relevance/) especially focusing on locally produced, ethical, and environmentally-friendly goods.

All of these are correct, though I believe conscious consumerism is still a little different. It can be narrowed down from 'always conscious', but is more generous than just looking at labels or being aware of purchases. Moreover, conscious consumer is a spectrum: it can also be applied to individual purchases or decisions, or lived as entire way of being.

For conscious consumerism to be the most effective, it needs an individual to consider two things:

1.) Conscious consumerism is not just limited to purchasing. Purchases are an extension of our daily habits, values, background, impulses, even our attention span. Part of being a conscious consumer means not only to be aware of our purchases, but to be aware of ourselves, and how our beliefs and habits shape the choices we make. 

2.) Conscious consumerism is a lifestyle - one that focuses on locally produced, ethical, and environmentally -friendly goods, but more generally seeks to be low-impact; to be mindful of how your decisions can effect the environment, other people, and your own personal health.

Altogether, a conscious consumer lifestyle is one that is healthy, sustainable, and ultimately, cheaper. As you seek choices that boost your health, the environments, and other peoples, you are also consuming less and generating less waste! And as an added perk, you save money too!
