About Blaire

I am freelance writer and editor covering environmental conservation, sustainable food systems, personal health, travel, people, media literacy, and behavioral science. I have a Cognitive Science degree from the University of California Santa Cruz, which broadly covered neurology, social systems, linguistics, and psychology. While my professional background is in media literacy and misinformation research, I have experience from many diverse fields, from reporting, to teaching, to storytelling, giving me a unique and diverse perspective. 

More about me:

I love camping and hiking, especially when I can combine the two into backpacking! In the summer of 2020, my partner and I spent 3 months camping, hiking, and backpacking the Western US. It was still early in the pandemic - I had been laid off and he quit his job in preparation for grad school. After 3 weeks of intense planning and supply gathering, we packed our ‘96 Toyota Tacoma to the brim with a 32-gallon water tank, all the essential camping and backpacking gear (and as we discovered later – so much more inessential gear), our mountain bikes, and a large box of board games. Click here to read about what we learned while planning and packing, here for all the reasons we didn’t hate each other by the end (despite our friend’s and family’s assumptions), and here for our favorite stops and must sees.

In my day-to-day life, I love experimenting in the kitchen, whether through cooking, baking, canning, or fermenting, though I get the most enjoyment out of baking. I am especially skilled at balancing multiple dinner plates and platters and eyeballing the best fit Tupperware for left-overs.

My hobbies include writing, brainstorming for the blog, and reading. During the winter, I enjoy snowboarding every few weeks, and occasionally ice-skating, though I’m no better at it now than when I was I was toddler. And of course, I always love getting the chance to hang out with friends and family.

Finally, my favorite activity is beach volleyball. After living by the ocean, I befriended a group of volleyball players and started to play a few times a week. I was terrible at first, but as I got better, and widened my group of volleyball friends, I came to love the whole process of playing, from actual games, to hanging out with people between games, to hanging out at the beach for a few hours. Now, beach volleyball is an activity I make time for when the opportunity strikes, though in colder environments, I’ll switch to indoor no problem!

 

About this blog - 

I hope to use my experience, knowledge, and enthusiasm to guide the everyday conscious consumer - making decisions and building habits that allow individuals to sustain a healthier, more sustainable, and in the end, cheaper lifestyle.

In the past few years, I have become very health and sustainability conscious. I have always been the frugal type, having been raised by financially scrupulous parents. In college, I became aware of the fact that most of my frugal habits were incidentally also sustainable and, in some respects, healthy. For instance, bringing my own bags to the store, avoiding take-out, reusing jars and containers, etc. 

I was raised with a lifestyle very similar to the one I currently have, so in many ways I am just promoting my parent’s lifestyle. But previously, I never had reasons for my habits – I mostly did them, because it didn’t occur to me not to.

My journey to this blog was a gradual awakening, as day after day I became aware of habits I didn't realize I had, or didn't realize had such an impact on mine and the environment's health. After meta-analyzing my choices time and again, I tried to determine the most ethical version of my decisions. I searched for healthier solutions and habits that least impact (and hopefully support) my personal health and the environment at large. 

I'm constantly learning, about myself and the surrounding the world. And new research to the field provides even more insight and opportunities for growth. Through this blog, I'll share what I've learned and along the way, provide in-depth reporting on complex nuanced topics to explain my decisions. I hope this information can help others become conscious consumers - from beginners to those who have maintained these habits for years.

 

 

What do I mean by health?

Health is a spectrum. When I refer to health, I mostly mean personal health, but it also applies to environmental health.

Personal health too means several things: diet, exercise, hygiene, emotional stability, and other forms of wellness. Environmental health, refers not only to the environment at large, but also to one’s immediate surrounding environment.

 

 

 

 

Why I created this blog:

As a kid, I was active and excited by nature. I also grew up in a rural part of the mountains, which lead me to have a natural respect for the environment. But in my teens and early 20’s I started thinking more deeply about my individual impact on my surrounding environment. And how I could make changes to my daily habits that could reduce my impact. This feeling heightened the more I tuned into the world around me.

It was difficult to hear about the onslaught of natural disasters occurring over the years or the forecasts of what our world would look like in 20, 50, 100 years due to Climate Change. Not only because it’s sad to think of the Earth, our home, changing, but also because the rate of human change does not follow Earth’s change, and it’s heartbreaking to hear of the damage Climate Change causes for populations around the world. I felt, and still feel, a deep existential dread.

On top of that, in the US alone, we are reckoning with a social landscape that subsidizes some groups and undercuts others. As a white women born into an average middle-class upbringing, I am privy to more security than others, and I don’t want to take that lightly. While this might not obviously connect to health, sustainability, and frugality, I believe that our choices are not mutually exclusive, but have holistic rippling effects that connect the world. 

The cellphone I decided to buy two years ago because it was cheap, durable, straightforward, and, importantly, not an Apple product? It was made in China. But really, it was only assembled in China. The individual parts were manufactured in a dozen other countries, processed from materials mined from a dozen more, with freighters transporting the materials back and forth across the globe. Once assembled, it was then probably shipped to the US or elsewhere before getting to the US, where it was shipped some more to new facilities, and passed between dozens of pairs of hands belonging, more than likely, to low-wage workers, a majority of whom belong to marginalized populations. This all before it was packaged and sent to me. 

Not only did this small, seemingly insignificant, decision touch so many people from around the world, the environment was also impacted as the mining of materials and transportation destroys habitats and pollutes our natural environments.

I realize that this could be perceived as me soliloquizing to everyone to never buy anything ever in case it leaves a mark. That is not what I mean. I say this instead because I hope for individual’s to be more conscious of their choices. To analyze their decisions: where their products come from, how they are made, who is profiting from them etc. And on the flip side: do you really need that item? Is there something else you could use instead? Will that impact your health? And the list goes on.

Being conscious of one’s decisions, I believe, reduces your consumption, waste, and ultimately environmental and socially advantageous impact.

 

A couple notes that I feel the need to address as I write this:

1. When reading this, it’s easy to think I’m saying that the time we are living in now is the worst it’s ever been. However, in reality, I think it’s over-aggrandizing to say that as I’m sure every generation can point to contemporary events of the same nature. Instead, I hope to relate that current events and forecasts concern me. And this makes me hyper aware of the choices I make and what I can do to help others if they choose to approach this lifestyle similarly. 

2. I’ve had discussions over the years with multiple people about how the problems of today are not an individual’s problems to solve – they are the companies, governments, corporations, etc. that have created oceans of wasteland and promoted over-consumption through psychological manipulation and unfair commercial practices (among others) on such a massive scale that it would be impossible to make a difference. While I agree that as an individual, I’m not going to move the needle enough, I still hope to promote a lifestyle where I don’t support policy decisions or products that perpetuate these problems. Don't let best be the enemy of better. Best would be the companies paying retribution for their greed. But better, is what I'm able to do, which helps even on the smallest of scales. In a way, I’m voting with my dollar, but in the end I'm voting with my lifestyle.
