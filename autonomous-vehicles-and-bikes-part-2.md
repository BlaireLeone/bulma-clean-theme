## Part 2 - Can autonomous vehicles (AVs) sense bicycles? How sustainable are AVs? And how could current AV popularity shape the future of bicycling in the US?



### *Elaine Herzberg*

In March 2018, [Elaine Herzberg](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2019/03/08/uber-got-off-the-hook-for-killing-a-pedestrian-with-its-self-driving-car/) was struck and killed by an Uber owned self-driving vehicle out for a test drive, as she walked her bike across an Arizona street. She was the first AV-related pedestrian fatality. It should be noted, however, that a backup driver was behind the wheel, and the AEBs had been disabled, so the exact degree of the car’s (and by extension Uber’s) fault is indeterminate.[[1\]](#_ftn1) It was presumed that the car recognized neither Herzberg nor the shape of her bag-laden bicycle, suggesting a lack of thorough vetting for AV’s bicycle identification models. The difference between Tom’s and Elaine’s incidents, however, is that Tom was the unfortunate recipient of an operational braking system, attempting to circumvent collision with a pedestrian. Elaine on the other hand, was the pedestrian in this case, however, the system was not operational, nor did it detect her existence until it was too late.

According to [a report](https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/HAR1903.pdf) released by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) after the accident, the vehicle had flashed a warning of a potential object in the roadway, but only 5.6 seconds before impact. Within this period, the vehicle classified Elaine as another vehicle, an unidentifiable object, a pedestrian, and a bicyclist. While ample theoretical inquiry could debate the culpability of Uber and its alleged technological corner-cutting, what is important for this article is why the system wasn’t able to identify her, and furthermore, predict her movements (i.e. how fast she was going, what orientation she exhibited, what direction she was moving). And with that, how much did her bike affect the way she was perceived?



**So, what of bikes?**

Bicyclists have had a contentious history with vehicles. Given their lack of protection, meeting in unexpected road combat with a vehicle will more than likely result in the [cyclist being injured](file:///D:/hogwash/cyclist injured) if not killed. In [2017](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812765), 783 bicyclists died on US roadways[[4\]](#_ftn4); 96% (or 753) of those deaths involved a vehicle. Most of the time, this is due to simply not seeing the cyclist; bikes are small and often situated below the driver’s line of sight, and because of their maneuverability, they zip through traffic, perhaps coming up on a driver unawares; a driver may also neglect to check, as happens when opening a door into a bike lane. Either way, drivers are liable to fatally injure a cyclist whether they realize it or not. Take for example, [Katie Mckenna](https://www.rd.com/article/run-over-by-an-eighteen-wheeler/), a New York cyclist turned author and motivational speaker. She was run over by an 18-wheeled truck when it failed to notice her while maneuvering a right turn at an intersection. In [her book](https://www.amazon.com/How-Get-Run-Over-Truck-ebook/dp/B01LY9PYBR), she pulls no punches when identifying bicyclist’s vulnerability on the roadway; the first line queries, “So, how do you get run over by a truck? My first recommendation is to ride a bicycle”. According to her book, she signaled in every way possible that she was there, even wearing bright clothing. This is a sensationalist example, but one that exemplifies a common problem bicyclists have with surrounding vehicles.

*AV Bike Troubles*

As it turns out, AVs have been having trouble with bikes since their inception. A [Slate article](https://slate.com/technology/2018/02/self-driving-cars-struggle-to-detect-cyclists-bicycle-to-vehicle-communications-arent-the-answer.html) cites UC Berkeley research engineer Steven Shladover acknowledging: “Bicycles are probably the most difficult detection problem that autonomous vehicle systems face.” Unlike cars, which have a blocky shape with lots of mass and volume, bikes have a smaller inconsistent shape. Even when bicyclists follow safe legal procedures for switching lanes, the AI can have difficulties interpreting the shapes in its visual field; a bike gets bigger, in a 2D sense, when going from the back to the side views. When viewing the back of a bike, it looks small and compact. And without a holistic understanding of a bicycle’s appearance, it would be hard to predict how far forward the bike extends. So, when viewing a bike from the side, it seems to get bigger and change shape, a seeming improvement for an automated vehicle’s sensing capabilities. However, even this is easily misinterpreted as the side view has more negative space between the wheels and the frame. Not only that but putting an arm out to signal direction, wearing eye catching clothing, or attaching saddle bags and baskets can change the appearance of a bicycle.

And AVs do have trouble interpreting information in their visual field. Tesla vehicles have been noted to confuse the side of close semi-truck with a far-off billboard, and gas station flags adorned with brightly colored loopy writing for stop lights. Google vehicles, while acting in a preferably cautious manner, noticed movements of a bicyclist maintaining balance at an intersection as a sign of forward movement.

The following images exemplify the difference perspective can have on how a bicycle is viewed.

Several other kinds of bikes, though not widely used, are still considered legal vehicles on the road, and could thus confuse an AV's technology.

[[4\]](#_ftnref4) This report was released by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Unfortunately, I couldn’t pin down more recent stats. Also, they refer to cyclists as pedalcyclists here to include unicycles, tricycles, nonmotorized vehicles, and the like. I will only use bicyclists and cyclists in this article; thus, it’s important to note that these stats may be skewed as they include other kinds of pedal-operational vehicles.
