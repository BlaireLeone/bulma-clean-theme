March 20, 2020

A friend of mine, who I’ll call Tom, came home one day with a bandaged hand, bruised face, and a general look of shock and bewilderment. He had just come from the hospital after hitting a car on his bike. A negligent happenstance for some, but a truly unlucky feat for Tom. And to be clear, *Tom* hit the car while riding his bike, the car did not hit him.

Here’s what he told me: 

While riding into town, post-COVID shutdowns, the streets were deserted. This was around the start of quarantine, early April 2020 - hardly anyone wanted to venture outside. Nonetheless, Tom encountered one vehicle on his way.

After shooting down a short, but steep hill, Tom started gaining on a midsized SUV, let’s call it a Honda CRV. He was still coasting from the downhill and hoped to use this momentum for an easier ride on the subsequent flat part coming into town. 

Tom was accelerating so fast from the momentum, he started making moves to pass the Honda ahead of him. As he was coming up on the car’s back right bumper, but still a reasonable distance behind, a pedestrian ran through the crosswalk ahead of the car. As Tom put it, the guy appeared out of nowhere, whooped and sprinted across the road, then disappeared into a nearby park. And though the car was still a good distance from the crosswalk, it stopped completely, causing the back wheels to swing into the bike lane.  

Tom, still trying to maximize his speed from the downhill, ran arm-first into the back window, while his face swung around and hit the side of the car. His hand, probably in trying to brace himself, punched through the bottom right corner of the window and his arm went through to the shoulder.

While this may seem like a clear case of an overreactive driver, the driver, in fact, was not at fault. Instead, the car, a fresh-off-the-lot 2021 vehicle installed with an automatic emergency braking system (AEB), had made the decision to stop. Even though the car was far enough from the pedestrian for the driver to consciously reduce his speed, the whooper/sprinter was speeding so fast through the crosswalk that the car wouldn’t have hit him regardless (according to Tom), the AEBs had recognized a potential target and literally skidded to a halt. 

Both Tom and the driver paid for it, the driver in repairing his new car, and Tom with his medical bills and newly cracked bike frame (Tom is luckily the kind of guy that parades his injuries around with pride, and wasn’t deterred by the pain or broken bones).

**So, what does this mean?**

I believe there are several takeaways from this story, perhaps the least of which is the question of when it’s prudent for a cyclist to pass a vehicle, especially if it involves speeding. Legality aside, is doing so inconsiderate if not rash? In retrospect, Tom acknowledges that his attempt at overtaking the car may have been reckless. Given the flatness of the road, Tom’s experience as a cyclist, and the lightness of his bike, he had no need to save himself the pedaling effort nor outpace the only other vehicle on the roadway (though as a cyclist myself, I understand where his head was at - I cannot describe the satisfaction of passing a vehicle on your bike). 

But the question I ultimately believe to be most poignant here is that of how autonomous vehicles (AVs) will coalesce with bicyclists in the future. I don’t believe one could truly attribute Tom's accident to the AEBs, given that they were attempting to save the driver and pedestrian from needless harm. However, the fact that an accident resulted nonetheless suggests a need for further analysis of how autonomous vehicles interact with bicyclists, as they may not prioritize bicyclist's safety as highly as they should.

**But first – A Little Background**

What technology allows autonomous vehicles to be autonomous? And is it fair to question AVs in general despite Tom’s story only featuring AEBs?

In short, autonomous here means driver-less, or else, having little to no need for human supervision. But within this, AVs can be deconstructed into ascending levels of autonomy. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) categorized AVs in 2013, and then [updated them again](https://www.sae.org/news/press-room/2018/12/sae-international-releases-updated-visual-chart-for-its-“levels-of-driving-automation”-standard-for-self-driving-vehicles) in 2018, developing 6 tiers of automation.[[1\]](#_ftn1) While it includes Level 0, where the car is completely manual, the automation evaluation spans from Level 1, in which the vehicle only makes suggestions to a human driver, to Level 5, where the vehicle has complete control and passengers have confidence in not supervising. Between Levels 2 to 3, is the threshold between a human’s control and the vehicles; thus, Level 3 signals the beginning of vehicle autonomy. Despite some company’s misleading advertising, like Tesla’s “[full self-driving](https://www.thedrive.com/news/26700/tesla-puts-full-self-driving-back-on-the-menu-but-its-not-what-you-think)” tech package, as yet, no company involved with AV technology has reached level 5. The table below details the different levels.

[Simplified version. Includes more examples and year of initial or projected operation. Note: ADAS stands for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems.]

 

 

Looking back at Tom’s story, we don’t see a Level 5 driverless vehicle. Instead, his experience features a human-driven car equipped with AEBs, a form of brake assist designed to help the driver identify and avoid head on collisions, putting this vehicle between a Level 0 and a Level 1, according to SAE’s interpretation.[[2\]](#_ftn2) These brakes operate by receiving a command from a computer once it receives information from built-in sensors. When these sensors detect possible impending obstacles, they relay that data to the computer, which decides if they are indeed obstacles to be avoided; if so, the computer gives the word to brake. In other words, AEBs are a low-level form of artificial intelligence (AI). Like these AEB’s, AI makes decisions according to information it receives. While the AI of today is getting increasingly more complicated, thus analyzing a broader spectrum of data in more depth and outputting information akin to a human’s intelligence (and in many ways faster), at their core they operate by gathering, synthesizing, and processing data. Making decisions similarly to how an AEB makes decisions.

Thus, despite Tom’s brush with what could be considered a minor version of AI, these brakes are in fact the immature fledglings of a fully autonomous vehicle. More than that, the AVs of today are intended by some to be the prototype of a nationwide fleet of vehicles. Already, the technology that enables AVs has grown exponentially in the last decade, to the point where we currently see functioning Level 4 vehicles on roadways worldwide (albeit on a trial level as most are still under supervision, and prone to adjustments as the systems run into novel situations). And progress begets progress, as they say. Given this projected eventuality, I believe it’s fair to interrogate the nature of AVs in general, as they are poised to be the next greatest technological advancement since the bread slicer gave us sliced bread.

![Text Box: [This image provides many important milestones in automation history, however, it misses a few key pitstops. 1.) In 1939, Norman Bel Geddes created the Futurama exhibit in New York’s 1939 World’s Fair, sponsored by General Motors, and featuring an automated highway. The exhibit imagined the world 20 years in the future and was the largest scale model in history. 2.) More importantly to current technological advancements, in 1986, German engineer Ernst Dickmann outfitted a Mercedes-Benz van with autonomous technology and drove it around his university campus. He then began a partnership with German car manufacturer Daimler; Dickmann’s vision is just recently coming to fruition as social experimentation and technology are converging. 3.) This image mentions the creation of the DARPA Grand Challenge in 2004, funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a branch of the US Department of Defense. What this image does not mention, however, is that the first two challenges were long distance races located in the Mojave Desert with a 1 and then 2-million-dollar prize. The third challenge, in 2007, was an Urban course, located at an Air Force Base in California. Prizes were again $2 million dollars. DARPA has since continued with cyber, space launch, and subterranean challenges. 4.) In 2015, the Delphi Automotive driverless car becomes the first AV to complete a transcontinental trip from San Francisco to NYC. It completed it in 9 days. 5.)

[timeline of companies predicted to transition to Level 5 automation]

 

Driverless-ness, however, is a tall order. While certainly more than the sum of its parts, when disassembled, we can see the complex systems that AVs must employ to function. Among technologies like GPS, automatic braking, steering, and locking, AVs have what Alan Amici, vice president of TE Connectivity, an automotive company at the forefront of sensory technology, identifies as the 3 most essential AV elements: sensors, connectivity, and software/control algorithms.

*Sensors*

Sensors are pivotal to the car’s ability to navigate and more than that, they do the data groundwork, feeding information to the other systems to build from. Sensors must observe their surroundings, detect objects on all sides, identify curves in the road, etc. We see these sensors in the form of 3 basic technologies working simultaneously: 360-degree LIDAR and radar for object detection[[3\]](#_ftn3), cameras for cross-checking object recognition, and ultrasound for park assist. These provide the AVs with a visual field comparable to the human eye, allowing them to “see” as a human would and orient themselves in relation to the objects around them. While at the moment sensors may not outcompete a human eye, several benefits of this technology are that sensors are constantly vigilant, consistent in their estimations, and attending to all sides of the vehicle at once. 

![img](file:///C:/Users/bleoh/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image016.jpg)

*Algorithms*

All this sensory data, however, is useless to a system that can’t make confident, human-esque decisions; it needs an on-deck computer system to compile information and learn from the data accumulated until it has developed a situationally-aware, and in some ways, superhuman system[[4\]](#_ftn4). In other words, it needs AI. Essentially like a teenager with a learner’s permit, the system garners skill through experience. And in doing so, the algorithm learns to discriminate between ambiguous objects like a plastic bag and a child, a shady patch and a pothole, or highway construction and a cyclist. Among the 50+ companies involved with autonomous vehicles, there are dozens of models available. I’ll discuss one model in more detail later.

Not only do these models need to identify what they are looking at, they are also need to reconcile speed and direction of surrounding objects. And in doing so, an algorithm should be able to predict the movements of these objects to inform its own navigational decisions. For instance, if the vehicle wants to switch lanes, it must determine if any entity is currently occupying the space it seeks to fill, or if there is an approaching vehicle about to pass. If so, it must calculate that vehicle’s speed and adjust accordingly. Alternatively, if a deer runs across the road, while perhaps unpredictable, it would be useful to know if that deer would already be out of the lane by the time the vehicle gets there. Thus, in calculating the deer’s speed and direction, or in other words, its velocity, the AI may determine if it only needs to slow down instead of stop, perhaps saving its passengers unnecessary stress.

![img](file:///C:/Users/bleoh/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image017.jpg)[ algorithms]

*Connectivity*

Lastly, while the AVs are fully operational with just sensors and algorithms, they also need input from surrounding vehicles or wireless hubs (i.e. connectivity) if they are to be more efficient and operate in proximity. If a vehicle decides to stop because it thinks the plastic bag is a child, it needs to provide a forewarning to the next vehicle that it’s stopping, so the next car may simultaneously and safely stop or else provide a wide berth. Additionally, fleets of AVs on the roadway, if not interconnected, may be dangerous. Take for example two AVs on the outside lanes of a three-lane highway keeping pace with each other. What happens when they both want to switch into the middle lane at the same time? Perhaps an improbable situation, but one that could cause an accident, nonetheless. That may only occur, however, if they aren’t able to communicate their intentions and synchronize their movements. Thus, AVs cannot operate on independent systems.

![A picture containing diagram  Description automatically generated](file:///C:/Users/bleoh/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image018.jpg)[ connectivity]

More than that, connectivity could boost efficiency in driving. Traffic could synchronize[[5\]](#_ftn5), eliminating the-mile-long start/stop jerking; stop lights could become non-existent. In a large intersection, vehicles would automatically make space for each other. And, an overarching algorithmic system, essentially acting as an air traffic controller, could calculate each vehicle’s route, determine where each AV will be at any given moment, and ultimately, minimize everyone’s time in traffic. Vehicles could also receive moment by moment reports from traffic and accident centers, like The Department of Transportation, local newscasters, or Google Maps. This could be a boon for a vehicle’s passengers; AVs could automatically switch routes due to road closures, traffic, or iciness, saving passengers time and reducing contact with safety hazards.

 

While I’m not going to focus too much on AV connectivity technology, it’s interesting to note where the connectivity occurs. The picture below summarizes the big 5 in AV wireless tech; it just doesn’t identify the individual objects such as trees, buildings, rocks and the like, which may have sensors attached to them to inform AVs of their location. This could be helpful in circumnavigating unique roadway situations where a tree, for instance, is situated very closely to the road.

**So, what does all this have to do with Bikes?**

*Elaine Herzberg*

In March 2018, [Elaine Herzberg](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2019/03/08/uber-got-off-the-hook-for-killing-a-pedestrian-with-its-self-driving-car/) was struck and killed by an Uber owned self-driving vehicle out for a test drive, as she walked her bike across an Arizona street. She was the first AV-related pedestrian fatality. It should be noted, however, that a backup driver was behind the wheel, and the AEBs had been disabled, so the exact degree of the car’s (and by extension Uber’s) fault is indeterminate.[[6\]](#_ftn6) It was presumed that the car recognized neither Herzberg nor the shape of her bag-laden bicycle, suggesting a lack of thorough vetting for AV’s bicycle identification models. The difference between Tom’s and Elaine’s incidents, however, is that Tom was the unfortunate recipient of an operational braking system, attempting to circumvent collision with a pedestrian. Elaine on the other hand, was the pedestrian in this case, however, the system was not operational, nor did it detect her existence until it was too late. 

 ![A picture containing bicycle, outdoor  Description automatically generated](file:///C:/Users/bleoh/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image021.jpg)![A picture containing transport, car  Description automatically generated](file:///C:/Users/bleoh/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image022.jpg)![A picture containing text, road, way, highway  Description automatically generated](file:///C:/Users/bleoh/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image024.jpg) 

According to [a report](https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/HAR1903.pdf) released by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) after the accident, the vehicle had flashed a warning of a potential object in the roadway, but only 5.6 seconds before impact. Within this period, the vehicle classified Elaine as another vehicle, an unidentifiable object, a pedestrian, and a bicyclist. While ample theoretical inquiry could debate the culpability of Uber and its alleged technological corner-cutting, what is important for this article is why the system wasn’t able to identify her, and furthermore, predict her movements (i.e. how fast she was going, what orientation she exhibited, what direction she was moving). And with that, how much did her bike affect the way she was perceived?

**Autonomous Vehicle Stats**

*AV Collisions*

Despite sensationalist belief, Elaine’s tragedy was not usual. Or else, her accident – a head on collision – was not representative of most of the kinds of accidents that self-driving vehicles engage in. In the US especially, we are prone to think that fatal high-speed collisions are the norm for the AVs, given media coverage of such incidents as Elaine’s and also Tesla’s [numerous highway crashes](https://insideevs.com/tag/tesla-autopilot/). Nonetheless, [tentative research](http://www.umich.edu/~umtriswt/PDF/UMTRI-2015-34_Abstract_English.pdf]) from 2019 has shown that in actuality, rear-end collisions encompass the majority of AV accidents at 64.2%, a staggeringly high number considering that the next most frequent accident type for AVs are angle crashes (those that mostly occur at intersections where cars going at perpendicular directions or turning onto another roadway, collide) at 31.4%. Even [conventional vehicles](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812981) (CVs) with a human driver don’t get close to that rear ending stat; only 28.3% of motor vehicle accidents in the US are rear ends (Though rear-end and angle collisions are still the first and second most common crash type for conventional vehicles). On top of all that, AVs are far more likely to be rear-ended by other vehicles than to do the rear-ending themselves. It’s speculated that this is due to the unconventional way AVs drive. In sticking to the letter of the law as they are programmed to do, they tend to confuse human drivers who are more likely to speed, tailgate, hug the side line, shoot the gaps etc. And, as AVs are hyper aware of any pedestrians or vehicles in front of them, they are more likely to fully stop for their protection, encountering situations where human drivers may instead slow down, make a wide berth, or, if what the AV was perceiving wasn’t actually another person at all, keep on at normal speed.

Perhaps not surprisingly, because of this, AVs have a higher accident rate per miles traveled than conventional vehicles. A study from 2015 calculated that human drivers averaged anywhere from 1.9 – 4.1 crashes per million miles traveled (mmt).[[7\]](#_ftn7) AVs, on the other hand, average about 9.1 crashes per mmt. An alarming stat on the surface; however, as these accidents are largely in the form of rear-endings from other vehicles, they are not nearly as fatal or injurious as conventional vehicle crashes. On top of that, almost ¾ of the crashes occurred with the AV going at a speed of 5mph or lower; however, this again, is probably due to the excessively cautious driving style employed by AVs. But it should be noted that the report doesn’t detail how fast the other vehicles were going and thus how great of an impact the other drivers felt. 

While this study, [and others like it](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146520301654), provide confident results, three caveats need to be recognized. 1.) AVs, unfortunately don’t exist in the quantities needed to make meaningful comparisons with conventional vehicles. The data acquired from DMV[[8\]](#_ftn8) of combined accident rates for conventional vehicles totals nearly 3 trillion miles as opposed to 1.2 million by AVs. Put another way, that’s 1 AV mile for every 2,500,000 CV mile (10 full vehicle life spans). In fact, [a report](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1400/RR1478/RAND_RR1478.pdf) released by the RAND corporation (a nonprofit research institution) concludes that 100 AVs driving 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year, at an average speed of 25 mph, would need to drive for 12.5 years, or 275 million miles, to conclude with 95% confidence that their failure rate leads to at most 1.09 deaths per 100 million miles. A lot of numbers to process, but in essence, the sample size of this study was too small to make any generalizable statements. 2.) Another limitation the study notes is the context of the vehicle testing, or more specifically, where the vehicles were not tested – icy, stormy, or geographically unstable areas, or otherwise dangerous conditions. It’s unclear how many CVs are involved in accidents due to circumstances outside the driver’s control; it should thus be noted that AV collision results, could significantly differ depending on their location. 3.) The report specifies that none of the accidents AVs were involved in were the AVs fault, however, it’s unclear what they mean by “fault”. It could mean that the AVs didn’t collide with the other vehicles, and by that metric, it wasn’t the AV’s fault. Or it could mean, that the situations where the AVs stopped or slowed and CVs hit them were entirely justified (as in there may have been a pedestrian in the road) and therefore were not the AVs fault. However, as it has been suggested that so many rear-end accidents with AVs occurred because human drivers were surprised by the AVs behavior, I believe there is room to allow for AV culpability. If AVs are not following the intuitive rules of the road that every other driver subscribes to, they may lead to accidents that may have happened otherwise. Thus, I believe it’s prudent to reserve judgement on the exact safety viability of these stats until more information can be obtained.

**So, what of bikes?**

Bicyclists have had a contentious history with vehicles. Given their lack of protection, meeting in unexpected road combat with a vehicle will more than likely result in the [cyclist being injured](file:///D:/hogwash/cyclist injured) if not killed. In [2017](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812765), 783 bicyclists died on US roadways[[9\]](#_ftn9); 96% (or 753) of those deaths involved a vehicle. Most of the time, this is due to simply not seeing the cyclist; bikes are small and often situated below the driver’s line of sight, and because of their maneuverability, they zip through traffic, perhaps coming up on a driver unawares; a driver may also neglect to check, as happens when opening a door into a bike lane. Either way, drivers are liable to fatally injure a cyclist whether they realize it or not. Take for example, [Katie Mckenna](https://www.rd.com/article/run-over-by-an-eighteen-wheeler/), a New York cyclist turned author and motivational speaker. She was run over by an 18-wheeled truck when it failed to notice her while maneuvering a right turn at an intersection. In [her book](https://www.amazon.com/How-Get-Run-Over-Truck-ebook/dp/B01LY9PYBR), she pulls no punches when identifying bicyclist’s vulnerability on the roadway; the first line queries, “So, how do you get run over by a truck? My first recommendation is to ride a bicycle”. According to her book, she signaled in every way possible that she was there, even wearing bright clothing. This is a sensationalist example, but one that exemplifies a common problem bicyclists have with surrounding vehicles.

*AV Bike Troubles*

As it turns out, AVs have been having trouble with bikes since their inception. A [Slate article](https://slate.com/technology/2018/02/self-driving-cars-struggle-to-detect-cyclists-bicycle-to-vehicle-communications-arent-the-answer.html) cites UC Berkeley research engineer Steven Shladover acknowledging: “Bicycles are probably the most difficult detection problem that autonomous vehicle systems face.” Unlike cars, which have a blocky shape with lots of mass and volume, bikes have a smaller inconsistent shape. Even when bicyclists follow safe legal procedures for switching lanes, the AI can have difficulties interpreting the shapes in its visual field; a bike gets bigger, in a 2D sense, when going from the back to the side views. When viewing the back of a bike, it looks small and compact. And without a holistic understanding of a bicycle’s appearance, it would be hard to predict how far forward the bike extends. So, when viewing a bike from the side, it seems to get bigger and change shape, a seeming improvement for an automated vehicle’s sensing capabilities. However, even this is easily misinterpreted as the side view has more negative space between the wheels and the frame. Not only that but putting an arm out to signal direction, wearing eye catching clothing, or attaching saddle bags and baskets can change the appearance of a bicycle.

And AVs do have trouble interpreting information in their visual field. Tesla vehicles have been noted to confuse the side of close semi-truck with a far-off billboard, and gas station flags adorned with brightly colored loopy writing for stop lights. Google vehicles, while acting in a preferably cautious manner, noticed movements of a bicyclist maintaining balance at an intersection as a sign of forward movement.

[[1\]](#_ftnref1) Before the update there were only 5 tiers going from Levels 0-4. As technology progressed, Level 4 developed parts (a) and (b). It was eventually bisected into two separate levels.

It’s unclear if SAE sanctioned any of the changes or if they were simplified through the grapevine.
