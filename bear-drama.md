Climate change indiscriminately impacts everyone and everything. As a planet, we are scurrying to find ways to cope. Wildlife, too, must gradually adapt their behaviors to suit the surrounding environment, however, for some populations this may cause more acute growing pains than others as species and habitats collide.

California bears are one such species. While highly adaptable creatures, the rapidly changing environment has driven them further into urbanized and human-food laden places, creating dangerous situations for both bears and humans.

**California Bears: They're Undeniable**

------

Despite the variety of colors known to California bears, California only has one wild bear species - the Black Bear. Their fur ranges from black to tan, with occasional white chest patches. Black bears [exist across the country](https://wildlifeinformer.com/black-bear-population-by-state/#:~:text=A%20quick%20look%20at%20Black%20Bears%201%20Habitat.,sleep%20they%20go%20into%20varies.%20More%20items...%20); only nine states, including Hawaii, lack black bear populations, though even most of these have recurring sightings. In California, estimates vary, but [the current population](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Mammals/Black-Bear) generally lands around 30,000, with an average lifespan of 18 years.

Black bears prefer forested areas, and thrive best in ecosystems with [structural diversity](https://www.bing.com/search?q=structural+diversity+bio&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&pq=structural+diversity+bio&sc=1-24&sk=&cvid=57176C65051C4C82877CF88B5A1693C6) - a term used to describe an area with diverse vegetation, though not just diversity of species but also diversity of height and layout. This complements the bear's diverse diet; the omnivorous black bear is an opportunistic eater, meaning it will everything available: insects, nuts, berries, grasses, some meat, and now human food as well.

This map from the CA department of fish and wildlife shows the range of black bear's habitat in California. Note: in case it is unclear, the habitat is outlined by the black line.



**What significant impacts has climate change had on the California ecosystems that impact black bears? **

------

Rising temperatures propagating extreme droughts and historic wildfires have significantly impacted black bear's access to food and water forcing black bear populations to wander outside their normal habitat and upset their hibernation cycle.

While historically, black bears roamed much of North America, it's hypothesized that the large-scale hunting operations, deforestation, and permanent townships from Westernized humans, drove the bears into smaller more forested zones. However in the past 50 years, this pattern has reverse and we are seeing more and more bears wandering outside their preferred habitats - especially into urban areas. 

People and climate are the primary drivers for this gradual migration. People impact the bears in two ways. 1.) Advances in infrastructure into bear's current habitat are driving them into urbanized areas seeking food and escape. 2.) Some bears, as opportunistic and highly adaptable creatures, have been conditioned to prefer human food, which is sometimes more accessible than a bear's normal diet. These reasons are pervasive and well-documented, but manageable. Climate's efforts in black bear migration is less controllable. Rising temperatures from climate change endanger the bear's security just as much as people. And I would argue, exacerbate the  



Rising temperatures propagating extreme droughts and historic wildfires have significantly impacted black bear's access to food and water forcing black bear populations to wander outside their normal habitat and upset their hibernation cycle.







Over the last 50 years, a growing body of research suggests that the black bears that previously existed in forested areas are wandering further and further into more temperate, urban zones.

With their [*Urban Ecology Research Learning Alliance*](https://www.nps.gov/rlc/urbanecology/environmental-and-climate-change.htm), the National Parks Service studies climate change impacts in parks around the US. Of concern in their research is the effect climate change poses to wildlife, from rising temperatures to invasive species.
