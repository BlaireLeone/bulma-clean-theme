Since the new year, I’ve been reflecting on the implications of our planet’s volatile climate. While human populations around the world are at risk, it wasn’t until I stayed with my parents in the Sierra Nevada Foothills of California last fall and observed the local bear population that two things occurred to me:

1.) Climate change impacts more than just people: wildlife has also been forced to adapt - in ways that could be harmful to other species, people, and ecosystems. 

2.) Though the present is fraught with natural disasters like hurricanes, floods, and wildfires, the climate crisis isn’t just epic and catastrophic - it is also begrudgingly slow, comprehensive, and indiscriminate.

These biproducts of such all-encompassing circumstances are indisputable, and, at this point, too conspicuous to disbelieve. [Global temperatures](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) have been rising for well over a century. And wildlife, as proverbial children of the Earth, should naturally be impacted just as humans are. 

**California Bears: They're Undeniable**

------

Despite the variety of colors known to California bears, California only has one wild bear species - the Black Bear. Their fur ranges from black to tan, with occasional white chest patches. Black bears have an average life span of 18 years, and estimates put the [current population](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Mammals/Black-Bear) at around 30,000 in California.

Black bears prefer forested areas, and thrive best in ecosystems with [structural diversity](https://www.bing.com/search?q=structural+diversity+bio&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&pq=structural+diversity+bio&sc=1-24&sk=&cvid=57176C65051C4C82877CF88B5A1693C6) - a term used to describe an area with diverse vegetation, though not just diversity of species but also diversity of height and layout. This complements the bear's diverse diet too; the omnivorous black bear is an opportunistic eater, meaning it will everything: insects, nuts, berries, grasses, some meat on occasion,

  and now human food as well. 

Black bears are a common staple of Sierra Nevada Foothill life. With larger varieties of food and water sources, as compared to other areas in the state, they can thrive with lower competition for resources. Living in the foothills my parents see a lot of bears, especially in the backyard. And it’s no wonder. My parents tend a century old apple tree overflowing with apples every year - a bountiful honeypot attracting animals from miles around. 

In the last decade, however, the bear population who frequented this tree has shifted. Before, one reserved bear sporadically visited, sometimes with cubs, and the occasional straggler bear would make a pit stop during seasonal migrations. But now 3 bears stake out the tree for several months in a standoffish dance my parents refer to as their 'bear drama'. 

Normally, these interactions would have been an intriguing slice of "life in the food chain", but with the perpetual tinge of umber smoke darkening the sky from several nearby wildfires, these incidents feel more meaningful. 

**Bears Across the US**

------

As it turns out, my parent's backyard is a small microcosm of the greater California and United States. Black bears [exist across the country](https://wildlifeinformer.com/black-bear-population-by-state/#:~:text=A%20quick%20look%20at%20Black%20Bears%201%20Habitat.,sleep%20they%20go%20into%20varies.%20More%20items...%20); only nine states, including Hawaii, lack black bear populations, though even most of these have recurring sightings.

**Climate Change**

------

With their [*Urban Ecology Research Learning Alliance*](https://www.nps.gov/rlc/urbanecology/environmental-and-climate-change.htm), the National Parks Service studies climate change impacts in parks around the US. Of concern in their research is the effect climate change poses to wildlife, from rising temperatures to invasive species. 









One morning in October, my mom called and, brisk as always when relaying disturbing personal news, said, “You know, the bear broke into the house last night”. It had ripped through an open screened window and attempted to climb through. My mom woke to strange huffing noises coming from the living room, even more strange because the normally spitfire dogs didn’t notice. Turning on the lights, she made eye contact with a big head, one arm and shoulder sticking out around it; it  startled then and leapt into the night. Later, my mom thought it was the little cinnamon bear.

As it happens, this event turned out to be one of several encounters my parents would have with the bears, as they became more and more comfortable with my parent's presence.

It's likely that the cascading climate effects from wildfires to droughts to heat waves have corralled these bears and other animals to food rich areas like my parent’s backyard. With this in mind, I can’t help but feel that the encounter I witnessed was more than just nature’s survival of the fittest – it was a slow motion shifting of behavioral patterns as the bears experience growing pains in this new reality – one I am convinced is a rippled effect of climate change. But more animals mean more competition and less available food.

As long as I had known, the bears in this area were shy, avoidant. While much of the wildlife was familiar with humans in some respect, the bears at least had always maintained distance. But if it’s true that they’re now hungry and can’t fill up on traditional food sources, this may not always be the case. 

I’m not advocating for providing food to wildlife or curtailing their populations. But I think it’s worth considering the animal’s plight within our crazy new world phenomenon and how our beloved relationships with surrounding ecosystems could change.
