Though the present is fraught with hurricanes, floods, and wildfires, the climate crisis isnâ€™t just epic and catastrophic - it is also begrudgingly slow and comprehensive. As a global process, climate change indiscriminately impacts everyone and everything including wildlife, which must gradually adapt their behaviors to suit the surrounding environment. However, for some populations this may acute growing pains as species and habitats collide.

California Black Bears are one such species. While they are highly adaptable creatures, the rapidly changing environment has driven them further into urbanized and human-food laden places, creating dangerous situations for both the bears and the people living in these environments. 

**California Bears: They're Undeniable**

------

Despite the variety of colors known to California bears, California only has one wild bear species - the Black Bear. Their fur ranges from black to tan, with occasional white chest patches. Black bears [exist across the country](https://wildlifeinformer.com/black-bear-population-by-state/#:~:text=A%20quick%20look%20at%20Black%20Bears%201%20Habitat.,sleep%20they%20go%20into%20varies.%20More%20items...%20); only nine states, including Hawaii, black bear populations, though even most of these have recurring sightings. In California, estimates vary, but [the current population](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Mammals/Black-Bear) generally lands around 30,000, with an average lifespan of 18 years.

Black bears prefer forested areas, and thrive best in ecosystems with [structural diversity](https://www.bing.com/search?q=structural+diversity+bio&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&pq=structural+diversity+bio&sc=1-24&sk=&cvid=57176C65051C4C82877CF88B5A1693C6) - a term used to describe an area with diverse vegetation, though not just diversity of species but also diversity of height and layout. This complements the bear's diverse diet; the omnivorous black bear is an opportunistic eater, meaning it will everything available: insects, nuts, berries, grasses, some meat, and now human food as well.

This map from the CA department of fish and wildlife shows the range of black bear's habitat in California. Note: in case it is unclear, the habitat is outlined by the black line.



**What significant impacts has climate change had on the California ecosystems that impact black bears? **

------

Rising temperatures, droughts, and wildfires, with [well-documented](https://science2017.globalchange.gov/chapter/8/) links to climate change, have significantly impacted black bear's access to food and water leading to black bear populations wandering outside their normal habitat and upsetting their hibernation cycle.





Over the last 50 years, a growing body of research suggests that the black bears that previously existed in forested areas are wandering further and further into more temperate, urban zones.

With their [*Urban Ecology Research Learning Alliance*](https://www.nps.gov/rlc/urbanecology/environmental-and-climate-change.htm), the National Parks Service studies climate change impacts in parks around the US. Of concern in their research is the effect climate change poses to wildlife, from rising temperatures to invasive species.
