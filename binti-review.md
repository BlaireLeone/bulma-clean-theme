I'm in the midst of reading the third book, but I'll put in a review when I'm finished!

# In a Nutshell 

Character-driven and eloquent plot - some plot holes and lacking universal world building

Seems perfect for: someone looking for a fast-paced adventure and local world building, but not for someone looking for mood and a complex sci-fi universe

Genre: Sci-Fi, human interest, speculative fiction

Pages: 368 for all three books combined
