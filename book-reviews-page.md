I mostly read science fiction, fantasy, and general fiction, but I like to dip my toe into a good mystery or engaging nonfiction too! 

While I start a lot of books, I don't finish most of them. Often this is because I just didn't like the book or wasn't as engaged as I wanted to be, but I find that this depends just as much on my reading interests as on my current stress or workload levels. Either way, I only discuss the books that I finished, to give the book a fair shake.

Also, for each review, I give an elevator pitch outlining the reader who I think would get the most enjoyment from the book. Because everyone has book elements that pique their interests most, and because genres are so ambiguous and fluid - a person who likes mysteries may also enjoy a sci-fi with mystery tones.
