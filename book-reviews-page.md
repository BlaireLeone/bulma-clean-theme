I read science fiction, general literature, fantasy, and some mysteries. Please enjoy my book reviews, but be careful if you haven't read the book! I always detail what the book is about before hand, but in the review section I give away a lot of spoilers.

Also, I know that female authors are [often treated less seriously than male authors](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/18/male-and-female-writers-media-coverage-reveals-marked-bias), so I purposely refer to the author only by their last name.
