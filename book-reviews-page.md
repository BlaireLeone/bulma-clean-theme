I mostly read science fiction, fantasy, and general fiction, but I like to dip my toe into a good mystery or engaging nonfiction too! 

While I start a lot of books, I only finish about 75% of them. Some books I put down after a few chapters because I'm not as engaged as I'd like to be; other times I'm distracted by work or stress and have trouble finding the story thread. Either way, to give the book a fair shake, I only discuss the books that I feel other people would really enjoy.

Also, for each review, I will give an elevator pitch outlining who the book may be best intended for. We all read for individual enjoyment and we all enjoy different book elements. More than that genres are so ambiguous and fluid - a person who likes mysteries may also enjoy a sci-fi with mystery tones. Genre labels and back-cover summaries don't always give an accurate impression of the books mood and structure.
