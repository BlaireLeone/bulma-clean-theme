I mostly read science fiction, fantasy, and general fiction, but I like to dip my toe into a good mystery or engaging nonfiction too! 

While I start a lot of books, I don't finish most of them. While this is often because I didn't like the book enough to keep going, it can also be due my current stress or business. Either I didn't like it, or I might not have given the book a fair shake. For either reason, I only discuss the books that I finished, and I think are worth a read.

Also, for each review, I give an elevator pitch outlining the reader who I think would get the most enjoyment from the book. Because everyone has book elements that pique their interests most, and because genres are so ambiguous and fluid - a person who likes mysteries may also enjoy a sci-fi with mystery tones.
