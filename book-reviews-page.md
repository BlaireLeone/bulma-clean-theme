I mostly read science fiction, fantasy, and general fiction, but I like to dip my toe into a good mystery or engaging nonfiction too! 

While I start a lot of books, I only finish about 75% of them. Some books I put down after a few chapters because I'm not as engaged as I'd like to be; other times I'm distracted by work or stress and have trouble finding the story thread. Either way, to give the book a fair shake, I only discuss the books that I finished.
