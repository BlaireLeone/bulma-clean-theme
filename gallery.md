Honey is pretty sweet. It's flavorful, versatile, and medicinal! Honey is produced from bees, who collect nectar from flowers, eat and regurgitate the nectar several times, then fan the sticky substance with their wings to achieve the thick viscous sweetener we know as honey.

In fact, a 2013 survey from the National Honey Board found Honey is the most highly regarded natural sweetener, amongst others like granulated sugar, molasses, agave, corn syrup and more.

Honey is unique among sweeteners for several reasons:

1.) Every batch is different. Local beekeeper Mary Jo with McLaughery Farms says, "Honey can be manipulated for taste and vitamin content, but by nature no company or batch will have the same flavor". Since the flavor and properties of the honey are determined by the surrounding flowers the bees frequent, each batch is unique. Sometimes the nectar is sourced entirely from one kind of flower, sometimes from a variety of flowers. This affects not only the flavor but the color and aroma as well.

While clover honey tends to be the least flavorful, it is one of the most highly produced, even outside of Nevada County, because of the ubiquity of wild clover. Also in Nevada County, you often find blackberry and thistle honey as well. If you visit warmer coastal cities, like San Luis Obispo, you might find avocado or pomegranate honey!

2.) Honey is sometimes produced symbiotically with other fruit-producing plants - such as the avocado. Because of the biological constraints of the avocado tree, it needs an external propagator, such as the honey bee, to pollinate it. As the honeybee swoops from flower to flower to dredge up some nectar, it also collects pollen, which attach like velcro to the bee's hairy legs. It distributes these pieces to other plants of the same species as it continues to find nectar. 

Thus, it's not unusual to find honey and avocado products sold together from private farms, or for honey and avocado growers to partner together.

3.) Have allergies? Try a local honey! Mary Jo, HAALo's western homeopathic practitioner, recommends local honey for everyone in the Spring time, even those who aren't severely effected. "Honey is your medicine and your spoonful of sugar all in one!", she says. Because honey is created from the content of local flowers and allergies are strongest when pollen is blown around, by eating local honey, you are essentially inoculating yourself from pollen you breath in. If you start eating a local honey regularly in the winter, you can build up an immunity by the time Spring hits!
