Everyone loves honey. And not only can you find it in it's individual In fact, a 2013 survey from the National Honey Board found Honey is the most highly regarded natural sweetner amongst others like granulated sugar, molasses, agave, corn syrup and more (although it should be noted that maple syrup is not on the list, and this survey is based on participant's perceptions, not the actual sweetner properties). 

Honey is unique among sweetners for several reasons:

1.) Every batch is different. Local beekeeper Leslie Gualt with McLaughery Farms says, "honey can be manipulated for taste and vitamin content, but by nature no company or batch will have the same flavor". Since the flavor and properties of the honey are determined by the surrounding flowers the beas collect nectar from, each batch is unique. Sometimes the nectar is sourced entirely from one kind of flower, sometimes from a variety of flowers. This affects not only the flavor but the color and aroma as well.

Clover is the cheapest and most highly produced flavor of honey, even outside of Nevada County, because of the ubiquity of wild clover, but in Nevada County you often find blackberry and thistle honey as well. If you visit warmer coastal cities like San Luis Obisbo, you might find avocado or pomegranite honey!

2.) Honey is sometimes produced simbiotically with other plants and produce, such as the avocado. Because of the biological constraints of the avocado tree, it needs a honey bee to help propagate it by distributing it's pollen. As the honey swoops from flower to flower to collect nectar, it also collects pollen on it's hairy legs, which pick the pollen pieces up like velcro. It distributes these pieces to other flowers and other trees as it continues to find nectar. 

Thus, it's not unusual to find honey and avocado products sold together from private farms, or for honey and avocado growers to partner together.

3.) Have allergies? Try a local honey. Mary Jo, HAALo's western practitioner and home beekeeper, recommends local honey for everyone in the Spring time, even those who aren't severely effected. "Honey is your medicine and your spoonful of sugar all in one!", she says. Because honey is created from the content of local flowers and allergies are strongest when pollen is blown around, by eating local honey, you are essentially inoculating yourself from pollen you breath in. If you start eating a local honey regularly in the winter, you can build up an immunity by the time Spring hits!
