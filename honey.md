### The v*Herb*iage: Honey

Honey is produced from honey bees, who collect nectar from flowers, eat and regurgitate the nectar several times, then fan the sticky substance with their wings to achieve the thick viscous sweetener we know as honey.

## Honey is unique among sweeteners for several reasons:

##### 1.) Every batch is different. 

Local beekeeper Mary Jo Harris with McClaughery Farms says, "Honey can be manipulated for taste and vitamin content, but by nature no company or batch will have the same flavor". Since the flavor and properties of the honey are determined by the surrounding flowers the bees collect nectar from, each batch is unique. Sometimes the nectar is sourced entirely from one kind of flower, sometimes from a variety of flowers. This affects not only the flavor but the color and aroma as well.

While clover honey tends to be the least flavorful, it is one of the most highly produced honey flavors, even outside of Nevada County, because of the ubiquity of wild clover. Also in Nevada County, you often find blackberry and thistle honey. If you visit warmer coastal cities, like San Luis Obispo, you might find more exotic flavors like avocado or pomegranate!

##### 2.) Honey is sometimes produced symbiotically with other fruit-producing plants - such as the avocado. 

Because of the biological constraints of the avocado tree, it needs an external propagator, such as the honey bee, to pollinate it. As the honey bee swoops from flower to flower to dredge up some nectar, it also collects pollen, which attach like Velcro to the bee's hairy legs. It distributes these to other plants of the same species as it continues to find nectar. Thus, it's not unusual to find honey and avocado products sold together from private farms, or for honey and avocado growers to partner together.

However, avocados, and other insect-reliant plants, have a controversial story with honey bees. Avocados don't need them to pollinate. In fact, any insect or agile vector will do. However, traveling honey bee farmers will lend their bees to avocado farms and in turn get avocado honey. The problem? It intentionally silos the bee's nutrient source, and limits their biodiversity - an unhealthy eventuality for the bees if it continues long term.

##### 3.) Got allergies? Try a local honey.

Jasmine Noble, HAALo's western practitioner, recommends locally sourced honey for locals. "Honey is your medicine and your spoonful of sugar all in one!", she says. Because honey originates from the content of local plants, it can help your body develop a defense system against the airborne pollen come Spring. In essence, you are inoculating yourself against daily allergen intake. And if you start eating a local honey regularly in the winter, you can build up an immunity by the time those Spring blooms come knocking.
