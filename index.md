# About Blaire

I am freelance writer and editor covering environmental conservation, sustainable food systems, personal health, travel, people, media literacy, and behavioral science. I have a degree in Cognitive Science from the University of California Santa Cruz and a professional background in media literacy, misinformation research, behavioral science, and teaching. In my professional life, I've gained experience from many diverse organizations, from film-festivals, to nonprofits, to restaurants, giving me a unique and diverse perspective. 



## My Interests and Activities

I love camping and hiking, especially when I can combine the two into backpacking! In the summer of 2020, my partner and I spent 3 months camping, hiking, and backpacking the Western US. It was still early in the pandemic - I had been laid off and he had quit his job in preparation for grad school. After 3 weeks of intense planning and supply gathering, we packed our ‘96 Toyota Tacoma with a 32-gallon water tank, all the essential camping and backpacking gear (and as we discovered later – so much more *in*-essential gear), our mountain bikes, and a large box of board games. Click here to read about what we learned while planning and packing, here for all the reasons we didn’t hate each other by the end (despite our friend’s and family’s assumptions), and here for our favorite stops and must sees.

In my day-to-day life, I love experimenting in the kitchen, whether through cooking, baking, canning, or fermenting, though I get the most enjoyment out of baking. I am especially skilled at balancing multiple dinner plates and platters and eyeballing the best fit Tupperware for left-overs.

My hobbies include writing, brainstorming for the blog, and reading. During the winter, I enjoy snowboarding every few weeks, and occasionally ice-skating, though I’m no better at it now than when I was as a toddler. And of course, I always love getting the chance to hang out with friends and family.

Finally, my favorite activity is beach volleyball, and I make time to play whenever the opportunity strikes.



 

# About this blog

In the past few years, I have become very health and sustainability conscious. I have always been the frugal type, having been raised by financially scrupulous parents. In college, I became aware of the fact that most of my frugal habits were incidentally also sustainable and, in some respects, healthy. For instance, bringing my own bags to the store, avoiding take-out, reusing jars and containers, etc. 

I was raised with a lifestyle very similar to the one I currently have, so in many ways I am just promoting my parent’s values. But previously, I never had reasons for my habits – I mostly did them, because it didn’t occur to me not to.

My journey to this blog was a gradual awakening, as day after day I became aware of habits I didn't realize I had, or didn't realize had such an impact on mine and the environment's health. After meta-analyzing my choices time and again, I tried to determine the most ethical version of my decisions. I now search for healthier solutions and habits that least impact (and hopefully support) my personal health and the environment at large. 

I'm constantly learning, about myself and the surrounding the world. And new research to the field provides even more insight and opportunities for growth. Through this blog, I'll share what I've learned and along the way, provide in-depth reporting on complex nuanced topics to explain my decisions. I hope this information can help others become conscious consumer - to make decisions and build habits that allow for a healthier, more sustainable, and hopefully, cheaper lifestyle.



### What do I mean by health?

Health is a spectrum. When I refer to health, I mostly mean personal health, but it also applies to environmental health.

Personal health too means several things: diet, exercise, hygiene, emotional stability, and other forms of wellness. Environmental health, refers not only to the environment at large, but also to one’s immediate surrounding environment.
