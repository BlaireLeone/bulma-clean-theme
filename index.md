# About Blaire

I am freelance writer and editor covering science, environmental conservation, personal health, behavioral science, people, and media literacy. I have a degree in Cognitive Science from the University of California Santa Cruz and a professional background in media literacy, misinformation research, behavioral science, and teaching. I now work as a reporter for Lookout Santa Cruz in Santa Cruz, CA, while pursuing a career as a journalist.

**My Interests and Activities**

I love spending time outdoors, hiking, camping, and backpacking. My favorite activity is beach volleyball, but in between running around in the sand and spending time on the trails, I enjoy cruising around on my bike and playing board games with friends.

In my day-to-day life, I enjoy experimenting in the kitchen, especially with unusual ingredients and novel cuisines. I'm especially skilled at balancing multiple dinner plates and eyeballing the best fit Tupperware for left-overs.

I'm also an avid reader. In the past year, my family and I started an informal book club, which made me realize how much I love dissecting a good book (and why I decided to get a literature minor in college).

While originally from the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California, for the last 8 years I have lived in Santa Cruz, CA (with a brief 9-month stint in Chicago, IL), where I spend my spare time riding my bike, playing volleyball on the beach, and cooking enormous meals with my partner and friends.
