# About Blaire

I am freelance writer and editor covering environmental conservation, sustainable food systems, personal health, travel, people, media literacy, and behavioral science. I have a degree in Cognitive Science from the University of California Santa Cruz and a professional background in media literacy, misinformation research, behavioral science, and teaching. In my professional life, I've gained experience from many diverse organizations, from film-festivals, to nonprofits, to restaurants, giving me a unique and diverse perspective. 



## My Interests and Activities

I love camping and hiking, especially when I can combine the two into backpacking! In the summer of 2020, my partner and I spent 3 months camping, hiking, and backpacking the Western US. It was still early in the pandemic - I had been laid off and he had quit his job in preparation for grad school. After 3 weeks of intense planning and supply gathering, we packed our ‘96 Toyota Tacoma with a 32-gallon water tank, all the essential camping and backpacking gear (and as we discovered later – so much more *in*-essential gear), our mountain bikes, and a large box of board games. Click here to read about what we learned while planning and packing, here for all the reasons we didn’t hate each other by the end (despite our friend’s and family’s assumptions), and here for our favorite stops and must sees.

In my day-to-day life, I love experimenting in the kitchen, whether through cooking, baking, canning, or fermenting, though I get the most enjoyment out of baking. I am especially skilled at balancing multiple dinner plates and platters and eyeballing the best fit Tupperware for left-overs.

My hobbies include writing, brainstorming for the blog, and reading. During the winter, I enjoy snowboarding every few weeks, and occasionally ice-skating, though I’m no better at it now than when I was as a toddler. And of course, I always love getting the chance to hang out with friends and family.

Finally, my favorite activity is beach volleyball, and I make time to play whenever the opportunity strikes.
