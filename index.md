# About Blaire

I am freelance writer and editor covering environmental conservation, sustainable food systems, personal health, travel, people, media literacy, and behavioral science. I have a degree in Cognitive Science from the University of California Santa Cruz and a professional background in media literacy, misinformation research, behavioral science, and teaching. In my professional life, I've gained experience from many diverse organizations, from film-festivals, to nonprofits, to restaurants, giving me a unique and diverse perspective. 

**My Interests and Activities**

I love camping and hiking, especially when I can combine the two into backpacking! In the summer of 2020, my partner and I spent 3 months camping, hiking, and backpacking the Western US. It was still early in the pandemic - I had been laid off and he had quit his job in preparation for grad school. After 3 weeks of intense planning and supply gathering, we packed our ‘96 Toyota Tacoma with a 32-gallon water tank, all the essential camping and backpacking gear (and as we discovered later – so much more *in*-essential gear), our mountain bikes, and a large box of board games. Click here to read about what we learned while planning and packing, here for all the reasons we didn’t hate each other by the end (despite our friend’s and family’s assumptions), and here for our favorite stops and must sees.

In my day-to-day life, I love experimenting in the kitchen, especially through late night baking. I'm currently on a mission to develop brownie and cookie recipe ratios that detail all the vegetable, legume, and grain combinations that can substitute for flour, eggs, and oil - not because I don't eat these ingrededients, but because I love making changes to my daily eating habits that allow me to eat more whole plants, especially in desserts! I hope that these recipe ratios can help others be creative with the ecclectic hodgepodge of ingredients they have on hand when trying to satisfy late night cravings. (When it comes to kitchen life, I'm also especially skilled at balancing multiple dinner plates and platters and eyeballing the best fit Tupperware for left-overs.)

While originally from the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California, I lived for 5 years in Santa Cruz, California, where I spent my spare time riding my bike, playing beach volleyball, and cooking enormous meals with my partner and friends. I hope to recreate that lifestyle in the next phase of my life.
