# About Blaire

**My Interests and Activities**

I love camping and hiking, especially when I can combine the two into backpacking. In the summer of 2020, my partner and I spent 3 months camping, hiking, and backpacking the Western US. After weeks of intense planning and supply gathering, we packed our ‘96 Toyota Tacoma with a 32-gallon water tank, all the essential camping and backpacking gear (and as we discovered later – so much more inessential gear), our bikes, and a large box of board games.

In my day-to-day life, I love experimenting in the kitchen, especially with zesty spice blends and late-night baking. While camping, I was determined to eat hearty homecooked food, and learned how to make everything cast iron pizzas, to brownies, to fried rice - all on our little two burner camp stove. When it comes to kitchen life, I'm especially skilled at balancing multiple dinner plates and eyeballing the best fit Tupperware for left-overs.

I'm also an avid reader - I especially love fiction, science fiction, and fantasy, though I'll dive deep into the mystery and nonfiction section when inspiration strikes. In the past year, my family and I started an informal book club, which made me realize how much I love dissecting a good book (and why I decided to get a literature minor in college).

While originally from the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California, for the last 8 years I have lived in Santa Cruz, CA and Chicago, IL where I spend my spare time riding my bike, tinkering with my website, and cooking enormous meals with my partner and friends.
