**My Interests and Activities**

I love camping and hiking, especially when I can combine the two into backpacking! In the summer of 2020, my partner and I spent 3 months camping, hiking, and backpacking the Western US. It was still early in the pandemic - I had been laid off and he had quit his job in preparation for grad school. After 3 weeks of intense planning and supply gathering, we packed our ‘96 Toyota Tacoma with a 32-gallon water tank, all the essential camping and backpacking gear (and as we discovered later – so much more inessential gear), our mountain bikes, and a large box of board games.

I'm also an avid reader - I especially love fiction, science fiction, and fantasy, though I'll dive deep into the mystery and nonfiction section when inspiration strikes. In the past year, my partner and I started an informal book club, which made me realize how much I love dissecting a good book (and why I decided to get a literature minor in college), Check out my book reviews [here](/book-reviews-page).

In my day-to-day life, I love experimenting in the kitchen, especially through late night baking. When it comes to kitchen life, I'm especially skilled at balancing multiple dinner plates and eyeballing the best fit Tupperware for left-overs.

While originally from the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California, for the last 5 years I have lived in Santa Cruz, CA, where I spend my spare time riding my bike, tinkering with my website, and cooking enormous meals with my partner and friends.
