I am an emerging journalist covering environmental sustainability and policy, technology, food, media literacy, people, culture, and behavioral science. I am especially drawn to in-depth investigative pieces on policy and society, as well as writing about community and individual experience. 

I currently report on propaganda techniques and interview misinformation researchers for the Propwatch Project, an nonpartisan nonprofit seeking to educate the public on propaganda and misinformation techniques.
