I'm an emerging journalist working, freelance writer, and freelance editor. I cover environmental sustainability and policy, technology, food, media literacy, people, culture, and behavioral science. I'm especially drawn to investigative pieces on policy and society, as well as writings on community and individual experiences. 

I also report on propaganda techniques with *The Propwatch Project*, a nonpartisan nonprofit seeking to educate the public on propaganda and misinformation techniques. I write in-depth articles and interviews with misinformation researchers, including [writing on common techniques](https://www.propwatch.org/article.php?id=295) employed by state-sponsored social media trolls and discussing the relationship between state-sponsored propaganda and state violence through [an interview with misinformation expert, Dr. Josephine Lukito](https://www.propwatch.org/article.php?id=305). While working with *Propwatch*, I became involved with the *Journal of Media Literacy Education*, where I edit and publish manuscripts.

I started my reporting career working as an herbal apprentice and newsletter writer for *HAALo Botanicals*, a shop dedicated to educating and promoting all things botanical. While shadowing practitioners from a number of disciplines in my work as an apprentice, I also gathered content for our newsletter, I later titled *The v**Herb**iage*. I wrote weekly ariticles covering plants, harvesting, and the local community such as this article on [the albizia plant](/albizia) or this article on [harvesting and processing plants into dried herbs](/processing-herbs). 

Later, I graduated with a BS in Cognitive Science and a minor in Literature from the University of California Santa Cruz. In college, I worked as a psychology and writing instructor, teaching the foundations of psychology and working with students on their writing, while also mentoring them on how to write a research paper. Similarly, I worked as a research assistant in the *Spontaneous Communications Lab* of the *UCSC Psychology Department*, where I drafted literature reviews on the spread of fake news and the effect of power imbalances on conversation, and mentored interns on research validity.

During college, I was involved with several student ventures: I worked as an editor with *Chinquapin Magazine*, a student-run literary magazine, and ran monthly movie nights with the *Psi-Chi* club, an international psychology association. 

My appreciation for films and storytelling developed from my experience as assistant festival director for the *Nevada City Film Festival*, where I watched and discussed dozens of films with my team to determine their fit for the festival. 

I hope to combine my experience with storytelling, behavioral science, and media literacy to continue reporting on complex and diverse issues.
