I'm a freelance writer and editor, covering environmental sustainability and policy, technology, science, media literacy, people, culture, and behavioral science. I also work as a reporter for Lookout Santa Cruz, covering the environment and the local community such as this piece on [international student workers](https://lookout.co/santacruz/business-technology/local-business/story/2022-09-12/beach-boardwalk-global-student-workers-ambassadors-state-department-interexchange-santa-cruz-seaside-company) and this piece on changes to [CALFIRE helicopter technology](https://lookout.co/santacruz/environment/wildfires/story/2022-08-23/cal-fire-helicopters-fire-hawk-ask-lookout-what-was-that-big-helicopter-going-back-and-forth-to-the-delaveaga-fire-recently).

Previously, I reported on misinformation techniques with *The Propwatch Project*, a nonpartisan nonprofit seeking to educate the public on misinformation. I wrote in-depth articles and performed interviews with misinformation researchers, including [writing on common techniques](https://www.propwatch.org/article.php?id=295) employed by state-sponsored social media trolls and discussing the relationship between state-sponsored propaganda and state violence through [an interview with misinformation expert, Dr. Josephine Lukito](https://www.propwatch.org/article.php?id=305). 

I started my reporting career working as a writer for *HAALo Botanicals*, a shop dedicated to educating and promoting all things botanical. While shadowing practitioners from a number of disciplines, I gathered content for our newsletter, which I titled the v**Herb**iage. I wrote weekly articles covering food, plants, nutrition, and the local community. Find my work in the content bar to the left under Food and Plant Writings.

Later, I graduated with a BS in Cognitive Science from the University of California Santa Cruz. In college, I taught a Psych 100 class, teaching my students the foundations of psychology and the basics of writing a research paper. Likewise, I worked as a research assistant in the *Spontaneous Communications Lab* of the *UCSC Psychology Department*, where I drafted literature reviews on multiple studies, like one study on the spread of fake news and another on the effect of power imbalances on conversations.

During college, I was involved with several student ventures: I worked as an editor with *Chinquapin Magazine*, a student-run literary magazine, and ran monthly movie nights with the *Psi-Chi* club, an international psychology association. 

My appreciation for films and storytelling developed from my experience as assistant festival director for the *Nevada City Film Festival*, where I assisted with all stages of event management and coordinated 100+ volunteers.
