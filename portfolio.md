I am an emerging journalist covering environmental sustainability and policy, technology, food, media literacy, people, culture, and behavioral science. I am especially drawn to in-depth investigative pieces on policy and society, as well as writing about community and individual experience. 

I currently report on propaganda techniques and interview misinformation researchers for The Propwatch Project, a nonpartisan nonprofit seeking to educate the public on propaganda and misinformation techniques.

Some of my work with Propwatch includes [writing on common techniques](https://www.propwatch.org/article.php?id=295) employed by state-sponsored social media trolls, or a discussion with misinformation expert, Dr. Josephine Lukito [a discussion with misinformation expert, Dr. Josephine Lukito,](https://www.propwatch.org/article.php?id=305) about the relationship between state-sponsored propaganda and state violence.

I started my reporting career working as an herbal apprentice and newsletter writer for HAALo Botanicals, a shop dedicated to educating and promoting all things botanical. While shadowing practitioners from a number of disciplines in my work as an apprentice, I also gathered content for our newsletter. I wrote weekly ariticles covering plants, harvesting, and the local community such as this article on [the albizia plant](/albizia) or this article on [harvesting and processing plants into dried herbs](/processing-herbs).

I also work as a freelance writer and editor specializing in behavioral science, media literacy, and environmental poilcy and sustainability.
