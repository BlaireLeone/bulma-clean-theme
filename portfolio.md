I'm a freelance writer and editor, covering environmental sustainability and policy, technology, science, media literacy, people, culture, and behavioral science. 

I also report on misinformation techniques with *The Propwatch Project*, a nonpartisan nonprofit seeking to educate the public on misinformation in the media. I write in-depth articles and perform interviews with misinformation researchers, including [writing on common techniques](https://www.propwatch.org/article.php?id=295) employed by state-sponsored social media trolls and discussing the relationship between state-sponsored propaganda and state violence through [an interview with misinformation expert, Dr. Josephine Lukito](https://www.propwatch.org/article.php?id=305). While working with *Propwatch*, I became involved with the *Journal of Media Literacy Education*, where I edit and publish manuscripts.

I started my reporting career working as an herbal apprentice and newsletter writer for *HAALo Botanicals*, a shop dedicated to educating and promoting all things botanical. While shadowing practitioners from a number of disciplines in my work as an apprentice, I also gathered content for our website and newsletter.. I wrote weekly articles covering food, plants, nutrition, and the local community. 

Later, I graduated with a BS in Cognitive Science from the University of California Santa Cruz. In college, I worked as a psychology and writing instructor, teaching the foundations of psychology and working with students on their writing ability, while also mentoring them on how to develop a research paper. Similarly, I worked as a research assistant in the *Spontaneous Communications Lab* of the *UCSC Psychology Department*, where I drafted literature reviews on multiple studies - the spread of fake news and the effect of power imbalances on conversation - and mentored interns on research validity.

During college, I was involved with several student ventures: I worked as an editor with *Chinquapin Magazine*, a student-run literary magazine, and ran monthly movie nights with the *Psi-Chi* club, an international psychology association. 

My appreciation for films and storytelling developed from my experience as assistant festival director for the *Nevada City Film Festival*, where I assisted with all stages of event management.
