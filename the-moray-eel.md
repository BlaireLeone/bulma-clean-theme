Dr. Rita Mehta, a UCSC biologist studying animal physiology, behavior, and evolutional morphology, has provided some of the most significant research findings on moray eels. After discovering a unique feature of their physiology, she also discovered how this feature contributes to their eating habits and role within their ecosystems.

**Unique Biology**

Most fish have what are called pharyngeal jaws, a set of jaws located in the throat, which, in addition to the normal set of jaws in the mouth, helps them wrangle their prey. Using a suction-like method, fish suck prey into the oral cavity of the mouth; water sucked in with the prey carries it to the pharyngeal jaws in the throat, which then grab it and pin it down for digestion.

While similarly equipped with a second jaw set in the throat, moray eels have instead what are called raptorial pharyngeal jaws, which play a more active role in catching prey. Moral eels catch their prey with the sharp recurved teeth of their first set of jaws, before launching their pharyngeal jaws from the throat into the oral cavity to hook the prey and reel it back. This feeding method relies on elongated muscles that control the jaw set, which expand and contract with the launching method.

According to Dr. Mehta, “This is the first described case of a vertebrate using a second set of jaws to both restrain and transport prey.” Hitherto, the existence of these jaw types were only found in a select few species of invertebrates, illuminating a novel feeding regime for species worldwide.

**Feeding**

Eels, with their elongate bodies, (a shape they share with snakes, meaning their internal muscles and bones are stretched) survive in the twisted spaces of coral reefs. Likewise, their shape allows them to explore tight crevices for food. In doing so they can corner prey in the coral, stick their head in, and launching their pharyngeal jaws into the small holes. 

When it comes to large prey, Morays can also use what is called a ratcheting technique, which is often described as walking their jaws over their prey slowly creeping it into their throat. This happens via the ability of the first set of jaws to unlock, separating into two halves that can move freely from one another. After catching a larger prey type in their teeth, they will detach their jaws, and walk them over the prey until it is completely consumed. The pharyngeal jaws then take over, dragging the prey the rest of way back to the esophagus. (The ratcheting method is also used by snakes, further linking the two species.) The combination of theses two feeding systems in the Moray Eel present a whole new feeding dynamic, and create new questions concerning the morphology and functionality of this jaw system.

Many questions have been raised concerning the addition of raptorial pharyngeal jaws, of worldwide feeding mechanisms, and of the Moral Eel in general. As they are the only known vertebrates to use the second jaw set in the launching/retracting manner, there are many unknowns. Questions like - what other species have this feeding system? How can we find them? What other fishes can provide a similarly enlightening study? What other differences are there between Moray Eels and other species? – have arisen in process of this study. And which Dr. Rita Mehta and her team challenge in their quest for insight. Nevertheless, one caveat that appears to me is the subordination of morality to science. Though research may be fun and enlightening, it can only be justified to a point. Subjecting species to the terrors of research methods for the singular purpose of garnering knowledge proves nothing, and simply objectifies them as means to a scientific curiosity-driven end. A researcher should weigh the significance these insights have for us versus the significance of the study methodology for the species, with particular care to the question of ‘should we do this?’ over ‘can we do this?’. Morality should never take a backseat to science, and thus, should always be considered before undertaking the research process.
