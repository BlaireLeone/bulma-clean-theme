Dr. Rita Mehta is a UCSC biologist studying animal physiology, behavior, and evolutional morphology. Her work over the last two decades has provided some of the most significant research findings on Moray Eels, from their unique biology to their eating habits to their role within their ecosystems.

**Unique Biology**

Unlike other aquatic vertebrates (or terrestrial vertebrates like snakes) Moray Eels use a second set of jaws, raptorial pharyngeal jaws, to catch and wrangle their prey. While most fish species have a set of pharyngeal jaws lying in the throat, the Moray Eel is different, in that the second jaws can move in and out of the eel's mouth. Although the second jaw set is located further back in the throat, this feeding method works mostly because of the elongated muscles that control the jaw set, which expand and contract with the launching method. According to Dr. Mehta, “This is the first described case of a vertebrate using a second set of jaws to both restrain and transport prey.”

**Feeding Method**

Most fish species use a suction-like method to capture their prey. By sucking prey into the oral cavity of the mouth, water sucked in with the prey, carries it to the stationary pharyngeal jaws. Instead, moral eels catch their prey with the sharp recurved teeth of their first set of jaws, before launching their pharyngeal jaws from the throat into the oral cavity to hook the prey and reel it back into the throat.

”As mentioned above, the eel, like the snake, is elongate, meaning the internal muscles and bones are similarly lengthened. 



Hitherto, the existence of these jaw types were only found in a select few species of invertebrates; and even now the Moray Eel is the only known vertebrate species with this feature. Because of this, several challenging questions have been raised concerning the exclusivity of this feeding method, additional feeding methods yet to be discovered, the extent that this jaw type is used for, and additional connections that research of Moray Eels can reveal.

To begin with, with its long, elongated body, the Moray Eel is decidedly reminiscent of snakes. In fact, because of their similar forms, snakes and eels, share many characteristics. Most obviously, they are elongate and limbless, . Other surprising features however that coincide with their form connecting the two species, are the duo’s ability capacity for growth, as well as the ability to consume large prey whole. Additionally, they are also a keystone species, meaning they are top predators within their environment, and therefore crucial to the sustained equilibrium of the ecosystem. However, unlike the snake, a few are unique to the Moray Eel, distinguishing it from other species of a similar form or function, those being a small cross sectional area segregating its body into parts, as well as the lack of pelvic fins. The most striking difference however, discovered by Dr. Rita Mehta and her team, is the additional raptorial pharyngeal jaw, which brings a whole new feeding regime into the known methods of feeding for species worldwide.

Most fish species use a suction-like method to capture their prey. In doing so they suck prey into the oral cavity of the mouth, wherein water, sucked in with the prey, carries it to a second set of jaws in the throat, the pharyngeal jaws. Like other fish species, and as stated above, Moray Eels, also have the second jaw, however, unlike most fishes, this jaw set in the Moray Eel is not stationary. Instead, this species can launch their second jaw into the oral cavity in order to hook the prey that has been caught in the foremost jaw set, with sharp recurved teeth, before reeling it back into the esophagus. As Dr. Rita Mehta and Peter C. Wainwright describe, “This is the first described case of a vertebrate using a second set of jaws to both restrain and transport prey.”As mentioned above, the eel, like the snake, is elongate, meaning the internal muscles and bones are similarly lengthened. Although the second jaw set is located further back in the throat, this feeding method works mostly because of the elongated muscles that control the jaw set, which expand and contract with the launching method. Likewise, their slinky body allows them to survive in the twisted, spaces of coral reefs, the ability to explore tight crevices for food. Not only can the Eels themselves fit into a majority of small crevices, but also even if they are too small, the Moray’s can use their second jaw by launching it into small holes, catching small prey, and transporting the fish back into their throat.When it comes to large prey, Morays can also use what is called a ratcheting technique, which is often described as walking their jaws over their prey slowly creeping it into their throat. This happens via the ability of the first set of jaws to unlock, separating into two halves that can move freely from one another. After catching a larger prey type in their teeth, they will detach their jaws, and walk them over the prey until it is completely consumed. The pharyngeal jaws then take over, dragging the prey the rest of way back to the esophagus. (The ratcheting method is also used by snakes, further linking the two species.) The combination of theses two feeding systems in the Moray Eel present a whole new feeding dynamic, and create new questions concerning the morphology and functionality of this jaw system.

Many questions have been raised concerning the addition of raptorial pharyngeal jaws, of worldwide feeding mechanisms, and of the Moral Eel in general. As they are the only known vertebrates to use the second jaw set in the launching/retracting manner, there are many unknowns. Questions like - what other species have this feeding system? How can we find them? What other fishes can provide a similarly enlightening study? What other differences are there between Moray Eels and other species? – have arisen in process of this study. And which Dr. Rita Mehta and her team challenge in their quest for insight. Nevertheless, one caveat that appears to me is the subordination of morality to science. Though research may be fun and enlightening, it can only be justified to a point. Subjecting species to the terrors of research methods for the singular purpose of garnering knowledge proves nothing, and simply objectifies them as means to a scientific curiosity-driven end. A researcher should weigh the significance these insights have for us versus the significance of the study methodology for the species, with particular care to the question of ‘should we do this?’ over ‘can we do this?’. Morality should never take a backseat to science, and thus, should always be considered before undertaking the research process.
