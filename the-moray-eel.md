Dr. Rita Mehta, a UCSC biologist studying animal physiology, behavior, and evolutional morphology, has provided some of the most significant research findings on moray eels. After discovering a unique feature of their physiology, she also discovered how this feature contributes to their eating habits and role within their ecosystems.

**Description**



**Unique Biology**

Most fish have what are called pharyngeal jaws, a set of jaws located in the throat, which, in addition to the normal set of jaws in the mouth, helps them wrangle their prey. Using a suction-like method, fish suck prey into the oral cavity of the mouth; water sucked in with the prey carries it to the pharyngeal jaws in the throat, which then grab and pin down prey for digestion.

While similarly equipped with a second set of jaws in the throat, moray eels have instead what are called raptorial pharyngeal jaws, which play a more active role in wrangling prey. Moral eels catch their prey with the sharp recurved teeth of their first set of jaws, before launching their pharyngeal jaws from the throat into the oral cavity to hook the prey and reel it back. This feeding method relies on elongated muscles, which expand and contract with the launching method to control the jaw set.

According to Dr. Mehta, “This is the first described case of a vertebrate using a second set of jaws to both restrain and transport prey.” Hitherto, the existence of these jaw types were only found in a select few species of invertebrates, illuminating a novel feeding regime for species worldwide.

**Feeding**

Eels, with their elongate bodies, (a shape they share with snakes, meaning their internal muscles and bones are lengthened) survive in the twisted spaces of coral reefs. Their shape allows them to hide from predators in the coral, but also allows them to explore tight crevices for food. In doing so, they can corner prey, stick their head in, and snatch the prey out by launching their pharyngeal jaws forward. 

When it comes to larger prey, morays can also use what is called a *ratcheting technique*, which Dr. Mehta describes as walking their jaws over their prey and slowly creeping it into their throat. For this process, the first set of jaws unlock, separating into two halves that can move freely from one another. As the prey is guided through the eel's mouth, the pharyngeal jaws then take over, dragging the prey the rest of way into the throat. Despite the use of the raptorial pharyngeal jaws, this technique is not unique to the moral eel - eel's terrestrial counterparts, snakes are known for this technique as well.

The combination of theses two feeding systems in the Moray Eel, the raptorial pharyngeal jaw and the ratcheting technique, present a whole new feeding dynamic for aquatic vertebrates, and create new questions concerning the morphology and functionality of this jaw system.

As they are the only known vertebrates to use the second jaw set in the launching/retracting manner, there are many unknowns. 

Questions like - what other species have this feeding system? How can we find them? What other fishes can provide a similarly enlightening study? What other differences are there between Moray Eels and other species? – have arisen in the process of this study. Dr. Rita Mehta and her team in their quest for insight challenge these questions.
