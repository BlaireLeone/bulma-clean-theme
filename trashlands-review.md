# Trashlands **In a Nutshell** 

Character-driven and evocative, but plot-shallow with flimsy world-building

Seems perfect for: someone looking for mood and neighborhood immersion, but not for someone looking for action, complex plot, or air-tight world building

Genre: Sci-Fi, Cli-fi, human interest, speculative fiction

Pages: 384 

## **About**

Set sometime in the not-so-distant future, this book details the lives of a small community living in the vast maze-like wreckage heap of Trashlands. In this landscape, plastic is currency after devastating floods annihilated most of civilization and shut down plastic production. Trashlands is a small oasis in this wasteland. The presence of a functioning strip club, known also as Trashlands, instills a sense of community and stability. Both governance and economy, Trashland’s lecherous owner, Rattlesnake Master, rules his community with a plastic fist, and hires large muscled goons to enforce his autocratic rules. However, the presence of the strip club, and therefore the goons, ensures order as well as a steady stream of income for the locals.

Our main character is Coral, a scrappy plastic forager moonlighting as a scultor, hoping someday to save up enough valuable plastic to buy back the son she lost to child collectors. Coral, her partner, and her father, survive mostly by her work as a plastic picker. She hauls in plastic from the nearby polluted river, which they then trade for food and supplies at a local market. Though mostly Corals, the perspective flits back and forth between several characters, including her partner, her father, other residents in Trashlands, and a newcomer from the city.

The story begins with Coral as a teenager, but flashes forward to around the time the newcomer arrives. The narrative often steps outside of itself as it slips back and forth between past and present, allowing the reader to understand the characters how the characters evolved into the Trashland’s community.

## **Review**

### ***Pros***

Writing Style and Mood Building, Characters, Premise, Local World Building

#### Writing Style and Mood Building

In the beginning, I was captivated. The author has a beautiful writing style and eloquently evokes a somber melancholic feeling. Throughout the novel, I was ensconced in a stagnant tension, built from the characters themselves.  As the novel flips back and forth between past and present, the character's present struggles are revealed. It's clear that each character is haunted by some event(s) in their past and a majority of the novel is dedicated to reconciling those events with present circumstances.

#### Characters

The characters are very unique and fit within the framework of the community. Not only do we see a lot of Coral, we get to know the club owner, Rattlesnake Master; his best dancer, the tattooed but insecure Foxglove; Coral’s son, Shanghai, stuck laboring under a heavily guarded factory regime; and Coral’s father, the wise Mr. Fall, and self-appointed local schoolmaster. And the list goes on.

Writing this review, I’m also realizing that the characters don’t have unique voices, which I actually don’t mind. While that technique works for some novels, it can be distracting. Instead, Trashland’s characters all have the same introspectively observational tone.

#### Premise

The premise of the story - that of a world reliant on plastic - is another thing the author does well. It’s an interesting twist on the post-apocalyptic genre. However, it should be noted that the premise does much of the heavy lifting, as ultimately, the author is unable to flesh out this concept thoroughly. (more on this below).

#### Neighborhood Building

Altogether, the writing style, characters, and premise make for excellent building blocks for a complete story. And the author accomplishes this in the local sense. The world building around the community of Trashlands is incredibly detailed, thought-provoking, and dynamic. I enjoyed getting to know what it’s like living in a dump with strategically byzantine corridors, women who wear high heels made from wine glass stems, and a strip club that also acts as a decent motel. 

### **Cons**

Lacks plot, full

The story architecture lacked plot depth and character development, and the plot holes soon became too glaring to avoid.

#### ***Plot***

The plot has a very faint heartbeat.  It's clear that the focus of this novel is not the plot, but instead the character's existential feelings as they consider their lives. Though the plot here provides some sort of narrative, it has no intention of giving the reader a sense of purpose - i.e. there is no problem to resolve, no heartbreak or anguish to settle, no climax falling into a satisfying denouement where all troubles are resolved. 

Spoiler: While going into the novel, it seemed clear what the overarching plot was going to be (that of Coral finding her son), the novel spends most of its time considering it's options. Is it going to resolve Miami's problem? Is it going to resolve Coral and Trillium problem of living in Trashlands? Is it going to resolve the community of Trashland's problem of Rattlesnake Master's overbearing thumb? It is in fact, all of these. However, in the most disastisfying way - no rising action, no fanfare. The characters just decided they were going to do something and it was done. 

First Half:

The plot has a very faint heartbeat. It generally gets rolling with the arrival of Miami, a reporter from the city, who comes under the guise of covering the local community, but he instead is looking for something of his sister’s, which he believes to be lost in the trash heaps. He hires Coral to guide him and direct his search. However, that’s it. They briefly search, find nothing, and that is the end of that storyline. Miami stays however and follows Coral and her friends when they make a trip down the road to another community, but it’s clear that Miami’s character exists only to drive the plot around Coral. 

Last half: 

After discovering the existence of her son nearby, Coral decides to dance at the strip club. This was previously a repulsive thought, but the price for her son is a running car, and Rattlesnake Master is the only one with diesel. The terms of his trade? Coral dances for him and she gets her oil.

Coral dances, and presumably to protect her honor and help her save face, Miami buys all the seats in the club so no one has to watch her dance. He then leaves Trashlands to head back to the city. Coral and her partner Trillium drive off in the bus they’ve been calling home to trade it in for her son. At the end of the novel, she runs into her son on the road, after he and a friend break free from the factory.

#### **Character Development**

Similarly to the plot, the characters lacked emotional development. While the characters are individually unique, they share one trait in that they are emotionally immobile. Not even the main character, Coral, changes as she sets out to find her son in the last chapter of the book. Her perspective and personality are the same as when we read about her as a teenager.

The only thing that jumps out as a difference in her behavior, is her decision to dance for Rattlesnake Master - which she was previously abhorrent, until she needed to for her son. But even then, it’s not even a change in perspective, but just one duty in a line of duties she performs.

This could be on purpose - to show how stagnant and demoralizing the characters find this world, however from a narrative perspective, I found it disappointing and dissatisfying. Especially because her characters being so unique, and her ability to create a mood, seem like the perfect building blocks for convinvingly documenting the character's emotional progress.

#### *Plotholes* 

I go into all the plotholes here, but it is safe to say that with a magnifying glass held the world of Trashlands, you can see an ocean of holes. Some of them were easily discernable in the character's motivations - it was just so bizaare for that character to do that.
