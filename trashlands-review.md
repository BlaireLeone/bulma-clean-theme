## **About**

------

Set sometime in the not-so-distant future, this book details the lives of a small community living in the vast maze-like wreckage heap of Trashlands. In this landscape, plastic is currency after devastating floods annihilated most of civilization and shut down plastic production. Trashlands is a small oasis in this wasteland. The presence of a functioning strip club, known also as Trashlands, instills a sense of community and stability. Both governance and economy, Trashland’s lecherous owner, Rattlesnake Master, rules his community with a plastic fist, and hires large muscled goons to enforce his autocratic rules. However, the presence of the strip club, and therefore the goons, ensures order as well as a steady stream of income for the locals.

Our main character is Coral, a scrappy plastic forager moonlighting as a scultor, hoping someday to save up enough valuable plastic to buy back the son she lost to child collectors. Coral, her partner, and her father, survive mostly by her work as a plastic picker. She hauls in plastic from the nearby polluted river, which they then trade for food and supplies at a local market. Though mostly Corals, the perspective flits back and forth between several characters, including her partner, her father, other residents in Trashlands, and a newcomer from the city.

The story begins with Coral as a teenager, but flashes forward to around the time the newcomer arrives. The narrative often steps outside of itself as it slips back and forth between past and present, allowing the reader to understand how the characters evolved into the Trashland’s community.

### What Trashlands did well

Writing Style and Mood Building, Characters, Premise, Local World Building

- **Writing Style and Mood Building**

In the beginning, I was captivated. The author has a beautiful writing style and eloquently evokes a somber melancholic feeling. Throughout the novel, I was ensconced in a stagnant tension, built from the characters themselves.  As the novel flips back and forth between past and present, the character's present struggles are revealed. It's clear that each character is haunted by some event(s) in their past and a majority of the novel is dedicated to reconciling those events with present circumstances.

- **Characters**

The characters are very unique and fit within the framework of the community. Not only do we see a lot of Coral, we get to know the club owner, Rattlesnake Master; his best dancer, the tattooed but insecure Foxglove; Coral’s son, Shanghai, stuck laboring under a heavily guarded factory regime; and Coral’s father, the wise Mr. Fall, and self-appointed local schoolmaster. And the list goes on.

Writing this review, I’m also realizing that the characters don’t have unique voices, which I actually don’t mind. While that technique works for some novels, it can be distracting. Instead, Trashland’s characters all have the same introspectively observational tone.

- **Premise**

The premise of the story - that of a world reliant on plastic - is another thing the author does well. It’s an interesting twist on the post-apocalyptic genre. 

- **Local Building**

Altogether, the writing style, characters, and premise make for excellent building blocks for a complete story. And the author accomplishes this in the local sense. The world building around the community of Trashlands is incredibly detailed, thought-provoking, and dynamic. I enjoyed getting to know what it’s like living in a dump with strategically byzantine corridors, women who wear high heels made from wine glass stems, and a strip club that also acts as a decent motel.

### What Trashlands could have done better:

Plot is flimsy and full of holes, narrative lacks lacks character development and universal world building

Some aspects of the book nagged at me. While I enjoyed the book while I was reading, I often found myself wondering *why* I was reading, and more than that it was hard to convince myself to go back to the book once I stopped. After, I realized that I enjoyed the first half much more than the second. The first half was a treat as it introduced me to a new world, with new characters, and new feelings. But by the time I got to the middle, I wanted something to happen. But by the end, nothing did happen, which made explaining away the lack of character development and world building plot holes difficult.

- ***Plot***

The plot has a very faint heartbeat.  It's clear that the focus of this novel is not the plot, but instead the character's existential feelings as they consider their lives. Though the plot here provides some sort of narrative, it has no intention of giving the reader a sense of purpose - i.e. there is no problem to resolve, no heartbreak or anguish to settle, no climax falling into a satisfying denouement where all troubles are resolved. 

Spoiler: While going into the novel, it seemed clear what the overarching plot was going to be (that of Coral finding her son), the novel spends most of its time considering it's options. Is it going to resolve Miami's problem? Is it going to resolve Coral and Trillium problem of living in Trashlands? Is it going to resolve the community of Trashland's problem of Rattlesnake Master's overbearing thumb? It is in fact, all of these. However, in the most disastisfying way - no rising action, no fanfare. The characters just decided they were going to do something and it was done. 

- ***Character Development***

Similarly to the plot, the characters lacked emotional development. While the characters are individually unique, they share one trait in that they are emotionally immobile. Not even the main character, Coral, changes as she sets out to find her son in the last chapter of the book. Her perspective and personality are the same as when we read about her as a teenager.

The only thing that jumps out as a difference in her behavior is her decision to dance for Rattlesnake Master - which she was previously abhorrent, until she needed to for her son. But even then, it’s not even a change in perspective, but just one duty in a line of duties she performs.

This could be on purpose - to show how stagnant and demoralizing the characters find this world; however, as a reader, I found it disappointing and dissatisfying. Especially because her characters are so interesting and unique, and her ability to create a mood, seem like the perfect building blocks for convinvingly documenting the character's emotional progress.

- ***Character Plot Holes*** 

I won't detail all the plot holes here, but it is safe to say that the plot wouldn't hold water. Some plot holes were easily discernable in the character's motivations - while reading, I would think how bizaare it was for a character to do this or that. Like for Miami to leave the city with all his savings, of which he strangely had a lot, and give Coral most of it to look for a small plastic item in the sea of trash, before suddenly leave, having accomplished none of his original goals. It seemed nonsensical - but from a the perspective of the whole novel, his motivations seemed to exist only to help Coral resolve her issues.

Other parts of the book applied sitcom logic (how can Jerry Seinfeld afford the nice Upper Manhattan apartment as a mildly successful comedian?). I found myself thinking how it was that Trillium, a tattoo artist, was making enough from his work to account for one and a half people. As Mr. Fall wasn't a family bread-winner, and Coral could only bring in so much as a plastic picker, did Trillium's work amount to enough that his time shouldn't be spent on another money-making venture? Was the tattoo business really that successful in a post-apocalytic world, when most of the tattoos he gave were names of fleeting amores? The author explains it away by saying the strip club was enough to provide a steady stream of customers, but I wasn't convinced, especially from how much it emphasized that Trashlands is a complex networkd of trash-lined corridors and manholes - nearly impossible to navigate as a stranger, let alone a drunk one in the dark.

-  ***World Building Plot Holes***


As I said earlier, the premise - that of a plastic-driven world - is different and interesting. However, it does much of the heavy lifting for the world building, as ultimately, the author is unable to flesh out this concept thoroughly. Plastic acts as currency, but where does the plastic go once traded? It seems that some people find the plastic useful for daily life, but I find it hard to believe that people in a junkyard wouldn't find scraps of other metals or materials to use instead, so they could trade their functional plastic. Which then gets to - where does the plastic go once it's been traded? We know plastic factories are still active in this world (since Shanghai, Coral's son was taken there), and that the quality of the plastic was low. So then why only trade big pieces of high quality plastic? It seems that the best way to maintain plastic as a currency is to value it by its weight. The factories could easily take buckets of plastic pellets - and pay plastic pickers by a steady metric. If the plastic pieces are being broken down and refurbished into something else, why not take tiny particles?

Coral, too, likes to make art from structurally-sound pieces of plastic when she's inspired. But it's a point from the beginning that she's trying to save up valuable plastic to pay for her son. I find it difficult to believe that she couldn't find scraps of other matierals in the junkyard as an outlet for inspiration - since she often remarks on how hungry she is in the mornings, how little they have, or that they can't afford to slack off. 

In the end, while I could suspend my disbelief that plastic was valuable for big intact pieces, the economy and character interactions with plastic were confusing and nagged me from the beginning.
