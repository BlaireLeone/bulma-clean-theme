**In a Nutshell** - Character-driven and evocative, but flimsy plot and leaky world building



**About** - Set sometime in the not-so-distant future, this book details the lives of a small community living in a vast maze-like wreckage heap of Trashlands. In this landscape, plastic is currency after devastating floods annihilated most of civilization and shut down plastic production. The people that left became wandering refugees searching for community. Trashlands is a small oasis in this wasteland. The presence of a functioning strip club, known also as Trashlands instills a sense of community and stability. Both governance and economy, Trashland’s lecherous owner, Rattlesnake Master, rules his community with a plastic fist, and hires large muscled goons to enforce his strict and unfair rules. However, the presence of the strip club, and therefore the goons, ensures order as well as a steady stream of income for the locals.

Our main character is Coral, a scrappy plastic forager and moonlighting artist, hoping someday to save up enough valuable plastic to buy back the son she lost to child collectors. Coral, her partner, and her father, survive mostly by her work as a plastic picker. She hauls in plastic from the nearby polluted river, which they then trade for food and supplies at a local market. Though mostly Corals, the perspective flits back and forth between several characters, including her partner, her father, other residents in Trashlands, and a newcomer from the city.

The story begins with Coral as a teenager, but flashes forward to around the time the newcomer arrives. This novel is not linear however. The narrative often steps outside of itself as it slips back and forth between past and present, allowing the reader to understand the characters a little more and how they evolved into the Trashland’s community.

**Review**- 

***Pros***-

In the beginning, I was captivated. The author has a beautiful writing style and eloquently evokes a somber melancholic feeling. Her characters are incredibly well-written and compelling. Each is unique and fits within the framework of the community. Not only do we see a lot of Coral, we get to know the club owner, Rattlesnake Master; his best dancer, the tattooed but insecure Foxglove; Coral’s son, Shanghai, stuck laboring under a heavily guarded factory regime; and Coral’s father, the wise Mr. Fall, and self-appointed local schoolmaster. And the list goes on.
Writing this review, I’m also realizing that the characters don’t have unique voices, which I actually don’t mind. While that technique works for some novels, it can be distracting. Instead, Trashland’s characters all have the same introspectively observational tone.

The premise of the story - that of a world reliant on plastic - is another thing the author does well. It’s an interesting twist on the post-apocalyptic genre. However, it should be noted that the premise does much of the heavy lifting, as ultimately, the author is unable to flesh out this concept thoroughly. (more on this below).

Altogether, the writing style, characters, and premise make for excellent building blocks for a complete story. And the author accomplishes this in the local sense. The world building around the community of Trashlands is incredibly detailed, thought-provoking, and dynamic. I enjoyed getting to know what it’s like living in a dump with strategically byzantine corridors, women who wear high heels made from wine glass stems, and a strip club that also acts as a decent motel. 

But it should be said that this is a character-driven story, thus the plot and greater world outside of Trashlands fall apart upon further inspection. Which brings me to the cons. 

**Cons** - 

The story architecture lacked plot depth and character development, and the plot holes soon became too glaring to avoid.

***Plot***
The plot has a very faint heartbeat. It generally gets rolling with the arrival of Miami, a reporter from the city, who comes under the guise of covering the local community, but he instead is looking for something of his sister’s, which he believes to be lost in the trash heaps. He hires Coral to guide him and direct his search. However, that’s it. They briefly search, find nothing, and that is the end of that storyline. Miami stays however and follows Coral and her friends when they make a trip down the road to another community, but it’s clear that Miami’s character exists only to drive the plot around Coral. 

After discovering the existence of her son nearby, Coral decides to dance at the strip club. This was previously a repulsive thought, but the price for her son is a running car, and Rattlesnake Master is the only one with diesel. The terms of his trade? Coral dances for him and she gets her oil.

Coral dances, and presumably to protect her honor and help her save face, Miami buys all the seats in the club so no one has to watch her dance. He then leaves Trashlands to head back to the city. Coral and her partner Trillium drive off in the bus they’ve been calling home to trade it in for her son. At the end of the novel, she runs into her son on the road, after he and a friend break free from the factory. 

**Character Development**

The characters are stubbornly emotionally immobile. If there was, Coral would be the only one developing, but as it happens we don’t see much of that. We see chapters of her as a teenager, as well as chapters with her son interspersed with the primary narrative, but even between these time jumps she is the same character. The only thing that jumps out as a difference in her behavior, is her decision to dance for Rattlesnake Master - which she was previously abhorrent, until she needed to for her son. But even then, it’s not even a change in perspective, but just one duty in a line of duties she performs.

The other characters similarly don’t show growth outside of slight changes. Foxglove, the best of Trashland’s dancers, is probably the most obvious, in that she decides to stop bullying her bodyguard. However, it feels like an afterthought, as if it comes at the very end and lasts for a few lines. Even Shanghai, Coral’s son, who we see only as a child before abduction, and then later as a teenager, stays the same. His rages in childhood last into his teenage years and he still assumes his mother doesn’t love him.
This could be on purpose - to show how stagnant and demoralizing the characters find this world, however in terms of narrative, I found it incredibly frustrating and dissatisfying.
