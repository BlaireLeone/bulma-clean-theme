## **About**

------

Set sometime in the not-so-distant future, this book details the lives of a small community living in the vast maze-like wreckage heap of Trashlands. In this landscape, plastic is currency after devastating floods annihilated most of civilization and shut down plastic production. Trashlands is a small oasis in this wasteland. The presence of a functioning strip club, known also as Trashlands, instills a sense of community and stability. Both governance and economy, Trashland’s lecherous owner, Rattlesnake Master, rules his community with a plastic fist, and hires large muscled goons to enforce his autocratic rules. However, the presence of the strip club, and therefore the goons, ensures order as well as a steady stream of income for the locals.

Our main character is Coral, a scrappy plastic forager moonlighting as a scultor, hoping someday to save up enough valuable plastic to buy back the son she lost to child collectors. Coral, her partner, and her father, survive mostly by her work as a plastic picker. She hauls in plastic from the nearby polluted river, which they then trade for food and supplies at a local market. Though mostly Corals, the perspective flits back and forth between several characters, including her partner, her father, other residents in Trashlands, and a newcomer from the city.

The story begins with Coral as a teenager, but flashes forward to around the time the newcomer arrives. The narrative often steps outside of itself as it slips back and forth between past and present, allowing the reader to understand how the characters evolved into the Trashland’s community.

### What Trashlands did well

Writing Style and Mood Building, Characters, Premise, Local World Building

- **Writing Style and Mood Building**

In the beginning, I was captivated. The author has a beautiful writing style and eloquently evokes a somber melancholic feeling. Throughout the novel, I was ensconced in a stagnant tension, built from the characters themselves.  As the novel flips back and forth between past and present, the character's present struggles are revealed. It's clear that each character is haunted by some event(s) in their past and a majority of the novel is dedicated to reconciling those events with present circumstances.

- **Characters**

The characters are very unique and fit within the framework of the community. Not only do we see a lot of Coral, we get to know the club owner, Rattlesnake Master; his best dancer, the tattooed but insecure Foxglove; Coral’s son, Shanghai, stuck laboring under a heavily guarded factory regime; and Coral’s father, the wise Mr. Fall, and self-appointed local schoolmaster. And the list goes on.

Writing this review, I’m also realizing that the characters don’t have unique voices, which I actually don’t mind. While that technique works for some novels, it can be distracting. Instead, Trashland’s characters all have the same introspectively observational tone.

- **Premise**

The premise of the story - that of a world reliant on plastic - is another thing the author does well. It’s an interesting twist on the post-apocalyptic genre. 

- **Local Building**

Altogether, the writing style, characters, and premise make for excellent building blocks for a complete story. And the author accomplishes this in the local sense. The world building around the community of Trashlands is incredibly detailed, thought-provoking, and dynamic. I enjoyed getting to know what it’s like living in a dump with strategically byzantine corridors, women who wear high heels made from wine glass stems, and a strip club that also acts as a decent motel.

### What Trashlands could have done better:

**Plot and character development**

More plot and character development - while the narrative is beautiful and allows readers to understand the characters, their traumas and motivations, these developments were the bucket sitting in a verdant colorful garden - functional, but awkward, placed there because it seemed like the best place for it to live. Plot and character development are intimately connected in most novels - one usually motivating the other, thus it's no surprise that in lacking plot, the novel also lacked character development. I constantly found myself wanting more - from the action and from the characters. 

As these details were lacking, the reader had no sense of purpose - there seemed to be no problem to resolve. While it was clear from the start that a problem existed, the characters made no moves to settle until late in the novel - the only sense of direction we really have. And as we the reader cannot see how characters react to the problem, we don't have a better sense of their progression and direction either.

**Plot Holes**

Perhaps because of this lack of foundation, the plot that did exist was full of holes - the characters decisions were often incongruent with their values or intentions and the world building in and around Trashlands had some glaring holes that required suspension of disbelief on a grand scale. It seemed that the author left a lot of questions and potential solutions unanswered.

It's clear that the novel didn't was character driven from the beginning, so I don't fault the author for detailing the characters and mood so thoroughly. However, I don't believe these are mutually exclusive elements, and I felt that the book could have been enhanced with a fleshed plot and without detracting from the emotional depth it already taps into.
