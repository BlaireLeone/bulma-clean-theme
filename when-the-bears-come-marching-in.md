Since the new year, I’ve been reflecting on the process and implications of our planet’s volatile climate. While human populations around the world are at risk, it wasn’t until I stayed with my parents in the Sierra Nevada Foothills last fall and observed the local bear population that two things occurred to me:

1.) Climate change impacts more than just people: wildlife has also been forced to adapt - in ways that could be harmful to other species, people, and ecosystems. 

2.) Though the present is fraught with natural disasters like hurricanes, floods, and wildfires, the climate crisis isn’t just epic and catastrophic - it is also begrudgingly slow, comprehensive, and indiscriminate.

These two truths are obvious. [Global temperatures](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) have been rising for well over a century. And wildlife, as proverbial children of the Earth, should naturally be impacted just as humans are. But prior to monitoring the behavior of these bears, I had never noticed these truths in combination, nor so close to home.

Bears are a common staple of foothill life; they are omnivores, [eating practically anything edible](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Mammals/Black-Bear/Biology#311311067-food-preferences) from ants to nuts, to berries, to grasses. Despite the variety of colors seen in California bears, only the Black Bear runs wild in California; their fur ranges from black to tan, with occasional white chest patches. Black bears have an average life span of 18 years, and estimates put the population at around 30,000 in California.

At least three of these California bears now frequent my parent’s backyard. And it’s no wonder. My parents tend a century old apple tree overflowing with apples every year – thus, a bountiful honeypot attracting animals from miles around. 

We usually saw one bear throughout the year - usually a she as her cubs arrived not too long after. Occasionally we'd see another bear, but they always seemed to be passing through as we'd never see them again. Sometimes these sightings featured a ‘teenaged’ bear that had been a tumbling cub the year prior. But most distinguishing about these sightings: they were unpredictable, intermittant, but structured. Though we saw them infrequently, they followed the same pattern - having arrived, they would spend at least an hour sitting in the tree before climbing down and scavenging for apples they missed on the ground. If they made it this far, they would amble off uunperturbed, howevever more often than not, they startled from something and bolted away.

Five or six years ago, my parent's noticed a new pattern develop. The bears showed up often, almost daily, and for longer and longer periods. Less keen on bolting when no obvious threat loomed, they stood their ground and stayed until presumably full. To make matters worse, three bears (the little cinnamon bear, the husky brown bear and her cubs, and the big male black bear) vied for the same space in a standoffish dance my parents refer to as their 'bear drama'. However, it never lasts long as the smaller bear unfailingly sprints away - like any of us, they are afraid of a bigger bear.

In the past, these interactions would have been an intriguing slice of life in the food-chain, but with the perpetual tinge of dark umber smoke darkening the sky from several nearby wildfires, these incidents felt more meaningful.

**Bears**

My parent's backyard is just a small microcosm of the greater California and United States, given that black bears [exist across the country](https://wildlifeinformer.com/black-bear-population-by-state/#:~:text=A%20quick%20look%20at%20Black%20Bears%201%20Habitat.,sleep%20they%20go%20into%20varies.%20More%20items...%20). Only nine states, including Hawaii, lack black bear populations, though even most of these have recuring sightings.

**Climate Change**

------

With their [*Urban Ecology Research Learning Alliance*](https://www.nps.gov/rlc/urbanecology/environmental-and-climate-change.htm), the National Parks Service studies climate change impacts in parks around the US. Of concern in their research is the effect climate change poses to wildlife, from rising temperatures to invasive species. 



One morning in October, my mom called and, brisk as always when relaying disturbing personal news, said, “You know, the bear broke into the house last night”. It had ripped through an open screened window and attempted to climb through. My mom woke to strange huffing noises coming from the living room, even more strange because the normally spitfire dogs didn’t notice. Turning on the lights, she made eye contact with a big head, one arm and shoulder sticking out around it; it  startled then and leapt into the night. Later, my mom thought it was the little cinnamon bear.

As it happens, this event turned out to be one of several encounters my parents would have with the bears, as they became more and more comfortable with my parent's presence.

It's likely that the cascading climate effects from wildfires to droughts to heat waves have corralled these bears and other animals to food rich areas like my parent’s backyard. With this in mind, I can’t help but feel that the encounter I witnessed was more than just nature’s survival of the fittest – it was a slow motion shifting of behavioral patterns as the bears experience growing pains in this new reality – one I am convinced is a rippled effect of climate change. But more animals mean more competition and less available food.

As long as I had known, the bears in this area were shy, avoidant. While much of the wildlife was familiar with humans in some respect, the bears at least had always maintained distance. But if it’s true that they’re now hungry and can’t fill up on traditional food sources, this may not always be the case. 

I’m not advocating for providing food to wildlife or curtailing their populations. But I think it’s worth considering the animal’s plight within our crazy new world phenomenon and how our beloved relationships with surrounding ecosystems could change.
